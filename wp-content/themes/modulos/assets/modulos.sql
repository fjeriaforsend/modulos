My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to improve the accessibility of your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Joe Dolson. Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer and a web accessibility consultant. He&#8217;s part of the Make WordPress accessibility team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled, finding and fixing the six most common WCAG 2 failures, highlight some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are, low contrast text, missing alternative text, empty links, missing form labels, empty buttons and missing document language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site. We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s opinion that you&#8217;re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there&#8217;s an ever-growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity. So now might be the time for you to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools, which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market, which claimed that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there&#8217;s real work to be done on each website, as they&#8217;re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast. There&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I do hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world we&#8217;re at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, and you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Joe Dolson. Hello Joe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Joe Dolson: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at WordCamp, I nearly said WordCamp Europe. We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;ve got Joe on the podcast today because he is doing a talk at WordCamp US. Do you just wanna tell us a little bit about yourself? Why you&#8217;re on this podcast, but then stray into what your talk is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] Joe Dolson: Certainly So I&#8217;m Joe Dolson. I&#8217;m a WordPress core committer. I&#8217;ve been a contributor to the accessibility of WordPress for quite a long time. I think I first started contributing in WordPress 3.4. I&#8217;d have to look at my history to actually know that for sure, but it was somewhere around there. So today I&#8217;m talking about a study from the nonprofit organization, WebAIM, out of Utah, in which they looked at the top million homepages around the web. The most widely visited, heavily known webpages, and did a bulk analysis of the accessibility issues on those pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I&#8217;m going to talk about six specific types of errors that they found constituted 96.5% of all detectable errors using automation. And the things that that exposes and how you can work with consultants. How you should use your time and how you should use automation to solve problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask how it is that you became interested in accessibility problems, given all the myriad things that you could have become interested in web? How did accessibility fall into your lap and create so much interest for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:51] Joe Dolson: So when I started my business in 2004, I started right from the beginning with the idea that I wanted to pursue accessibility in websites. And that was because when I decided to become a web designer, I wanted something that was unique about what I did. I wanted to do something that wasn&#8217;t just marketing. I wasn&#8217;t really interested in marketing. I&#8217;d seen a lot of that around and I&#8217;m like, boy, that, that just doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s socially motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Nathan Wrigley: Mmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Joe Dolson: It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s interesting. It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing something worthwhile. So I had to think to myself about, well, what do I know already? What do I have a unique access to that can make my business be a little bit different? And my mother was the executive director of a nonprofit that provided arts access for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for years, I&#8217;d had conversations at home with family when visiting my mother in her workplace about what people with disabilities needed and how the ADA worked, and how all of this sort of world needed to be constructed. So what I already had was a reasonably strong sensibility for why people with disabilities need access and the very fact of the modality of different experiences and different perceptions. And so with some study about the actual technical side behind that, I was able to pick that up relatively quickly. Which is not to say I didn&#8217;t make absolutely horrible mistakes in 2004 and five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s almost, it&#8217;s something that came from your, your background,. Your family enabled you to have some sort of prior wisdom. Most of the rest of us, I would imagine are coming at it pretty cold, and if we were to go back, I don&#8217;t know, 5, 6, 7, 8 years, I feel like nobody was really talking about this. I could be wrong. Obviously you were interested in it, but as a proportion of the people that were designing websites, I feel that accessibility was not on everybody&#8217;s radar. I would imagine that many, many of the websites out there were not accessible in any way, shape or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s become a real talking point in the last few years and people are making much more of an effort. Obviously you&#8217;ve got your conversation, your presentation at the event in the next couple of days. I&#8217;m just wondering if you could outline for those people who, maybe they&#8217;re new to WordPress, maybe they&#8217;re new to web design and they hear the word accessibility and they just think, well, I don&#8217;t know what that means. Just, in the broadest possible brush strokes. Just let us know what the 10,000 foot high version of accessibility on the web is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:31] Joe Dolson: So yeah, the 10,000 foot view. Accessibility, web accessibility, and the access to information for people with disabilities is about making sure that the content you&#8217;ve put on your website is interpretable to the most, the widest variety of senses. So for people who are visually impaired, that means making sure everything can be understood by what&#8217;s called a screen reader. That will look at the text content of your site, look at the code of your site and interpret that in voice production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people with hearing impairments, that&#8217;s about having captions for your video. It&#8217;s about having transcriptions of your audio files. So it&#8217;s really about recognizing that people have different ways of perceiving the world, whether that&#8217;s because of dyslexia, and they have difficulty with the way text is structured. Or it&#8217;s visually impaired, so that they literally cannot see your images and have no idea what that is. Your responsibility in sharing that information is making sure it&#8217;s available to multiple senses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your talk is called finding and fixing the six most common WCAG, W C A G, two failures. First of all, what&#8217;s WCAG 2? And then if you wouldn&#8217;t mind elucidating what are those six most common failures? Maybe we just go through them one at a time, and if we, if we stray off into a conversation about each one of them, that&#8217;d be good, and if not, we&#8217;ll carry on from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:02] Joe Dolson: Sounds great. So the web content accessibility guidelines is a document coming out of the W3C, the worldwide web consortium, and it&#8217;s kind of the international standard for what is considered to be accessibility. Version two is the version that was published in, I wanna say 2008. So it&#8217;s not new. But it&#8217;s been then updated periodically since then. The current version is 2.1. 2.2 is currently a candidate. It is likely to become a recommendation sometime at the beginning of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that just keeps incrementing different ways of looking at things and what is considered to be a standard internationally for what makes content accessible. It&#8217;s a very useful document. It is enshrined in law in a number of contexts. The US government&#8217;s section 5 0 8 is based on WCAG 2. A lot of international laws such as what the EU uses for their guidelines are based on WCAG 2. So being aware of these guidelines is pretty key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:07] Nathan Wrigley: Just before we go into the six areas that your presentation is about. When you say that the things are enshrined in law, and you mentioned the US and the EU in particular, I guess there&#8217;s going to be a whole swathe of different responsibilities and things that you are compelled to do. You are in the US, so just give us an idea, just paint the picture in the US specifically, and we&#8217;ll just ignore the rest of the world for now, about what the absolute requirements are. So, in other words, if you don&#8217;t satisfy this, you are in breach of the law. So are you able to speak to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:40] Joe Dolson: I can definitely speak to that. And it&#8217;s definitely good that we&#8217;re narrowing that just to the US, because otherwise this would go on for hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] Nathan Wrigley: One country time. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:49] Joe Dolson: So in the US, what we&#8217;ve got is section 5 0 8, which is part of the federal regulations governing the acquisition of software for government institutions. And that only applies when you&#8217;re getting funding from the federal government. So you&#8217;re only in violation of that if, for example, you&#8217;re a university and your website is funded by federal grants. And that is, 100% it&#8217;s based on WCAG 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few tweaks that are not exactly identical, but basically if you&#8217;re violating WCAG 2 at what&#8217;s called level AA, there are three levels of severity within WCAG. There&#8217;s level A, AA and triple A. Triple A is usually very specific types of errors that apply to relatively small populations and mostly need to be handled if you&#8217;re specifically serving that population. The guidelines, the laws are around AA, which is gonna be very broad, but it&#8217;s still, there&#8217;s got a fair amount of meat to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other law is the ADA, which is a 1991 law, and this may shock you, but at the time it was written, they did not directly address websites. And that does not mean that website accessibility isn&#8217;t covered by the ADA, and case law has repeatedly demonstrated through precedent, that yes, the ADA does require websites that are publicly accessible and commercial need to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is lacking in the US is any regulations that stipulate what that means, and that is a case where WCAG has not been brought into the legal bounds on these websites. And that is why you hear so much about so many lawsuits against companies for web accessibility. It&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t have regulations that allow anybody to easily look at their website and determine whether or not they&#8217;ve met those requirements. Really. the ADA stipulates your website needs to be accessible, it needs to provide this equal access. Figure out what that means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] Nathan Wrigley: You just mentioned lawyers and that&#8217;s kind of an interesting place to go just for a moment. It feels like there&#8217;s two premises here. We could have the carrot approach, or we could have the stick approach and the stick approach, by that, I mean is the threat of somebody contacts a lawyer and threatens to sue you because your website is not up to scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s the, uh, carrot approach, which is the kind of thing that I&#8217;m imagining you are doing. You&#8217;re involved in educating the community and, and making this stuff happen with a little bit of education. Do we need to fear the lawyers, the stick approach? Is that an increasing thing that&#8217;s happening? I mean, you see it in all other walks of life. People are sued for things that they haven&#8217;t done because people think they might be able to make a little bit of money out of it. Is that kind of on the horizon? Are people doing that? Do we need to be worried about the legal aspect?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:36] Joe Dolson: Yes, 100%. As recently as six or seven years ago, I would&#8217;ve said no, you don&#8217;t really seriously to worry about that unless you&#8217;re an international scale company. And that&#8217;s just not true anymore. And that&#8217;s directly because we don&#8217;t have those regulations. They&#8217;ve been slated to be added on many, many occasions, and keep getting canceled. They are currently on the docket to be created again, hopefully in 2023. But until that happens, we don&#8217;t really have anything that gives us a goal. And one of the things that regulations could come with is a schedule. A schedule of enforcement. That&#8217;s what certainly a lot of other places have done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The province of Ontario created a document, the AODA, which is a set of laws within Ontario for what is needed to accessible, and that came with a schedule of enforcement. Instead we have a free for all. Anything could happen. And there are thousands of accessibility lawsuits every year. And a lot of them are just accident chasers effectively. They&#8217;re not people with a very serious concern. They&#8217;re just looking for a quick payoff. And that is a horrible, horrible scenario to be in because you might receive one of these demand letters, and there&#8217;s a very good chance you are in fact in violation of it, and it is legitimate, even though they probably wouldn&#8217;t pursue it in court, but you can&#8217;t count on that. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a very unpleasant situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] Nathan Wrigley: That, is curious. But also, conversations like this and podcast episodes like this, at least we&#8217;re alerting people to the fact that this is something to be taken seriously. I wonder at what level, like you mentioned six or seven years ago, if you are a, a major corporation, you probably needed to worry about this. And then as though six or seven years have passed, presumably that barrier has gone lower and lower and lower. But at some point it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, you are going to be liable unless you take this sort of stuff seriously. Sorry, you were gonna say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:35] Joe Dolson: Right, right, right. I was say that there usually is a point when you get down into non-commercial websites, when things do get a lot fuzzier as to whether or not you&#8217;re likely to be liable, but that&#8217;s really a question that the law should be settling and the regulations should be settling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we should probably do is actually get to these six error types. All right. Let&#8217;s do it. So the number one is low contrast text, and that literally means where you have gray text on a slightly darker gray background, and it&#8217;s just hard to read. And there are a lot of very very specific calculations that determine in WCAG what is considered to be low contrast or not. It&#8217;s an extremely easy thing to test for, and it&#8217;s just a matter of trying to meet those guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody is trying to claim that these color perception tests are perfect. It&#8217;s a number. It&#8217;s intended to be there so that you have to meet this basic minimum. An important thing to remember about contrast is that this is not a scenario where higher contrast is automatically better. If you&#8217;ve met the guideline, you&#8217;re in perfectly good shape. You do not need to then go, oh, but I should probably just go black on white. That&#8217;s not necessarily better. There&#8217;s a whole population of people who will actually find that to be a completely separate struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After contrast, it&#8217;s all about, images and that&#8217;s images that are either missing alternative text, have generic alternative text, like just image or file or something useless, or are repetitive. And that&#8217;s going to be cases where maybe you&#8217;ve got a linked image next to a link where the text of that alt text is exactly the same as the text of the link, it&#8217;s just duplicate. It&#8217;s not helping anybody. These are also really easy to find because you can easily identify that your images have this really common recurring pattern. In a lot of cases in the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you might have a block pattern that&#8217;s producing an image with a heading and some text. And if that block pattern is just presetting an alternative text to something that&#8217;s not good, that&#8217;s where you might have a problem, it just needs to be dealt with and fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just interrupt there a moment, because a default install of WordPress will give you more than alternative text. You&#8217;ve got descriptions and captions and so on. You only mentioned alternative text. Is that the case? It&#8217;s just that one field that we need to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re describing what is in the image. So, for example, if there&#8217;s a red car with a, I don&#8217;t know, a dog in the backseat or something you would write, this is an image of a red car with a dog in the backseat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:15] Joe Dolson: That&#8217;s a great question. I&#8217;m gonna answer two parts of that. First of all, you don&#8217;t describe the image. You describe the purpose of the image, which may or may not be a description of the image. It really depends on the context. For example, if that image is a link to a post, then what that image is actually conveying to the user is, what is this link for? Which is not necessarily going to be what is the image of. Which is also a question for, is this the right image for this? If that alt text doesn&#8217;t make any sense with that image, then maybe this isn&#8217;t the right image. But ultimately what you&#8217;re actually describing is the purpose of the image. It might be that it&#8217;s an image of a dog in the backseat of a red car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I wanna mention about that is you would not say, image of. Because that is already going to be predicted and produced by the screen reader. They know it&#8217;s an image. You got that covered. And that is an extremely common problem actually, is people stating that it is an image? Totally unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So we went through number one and number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] Joe Dolson: Well, there was another part of that, which is the WordPress fields. So the WordPress media library has four fields that can be filled in. Title, alternative text, caption and description. Those four things all serve completely different purposes. The title is really only for administrative use. In very old versions of WordPress, it was used to add a title attribute, but that has not been the case for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative text is the thing that basically represents the image. It&#8217;s the alternative to the image. When that image is not available, whether it&#8217;s because somebody can&#8217;t perceive it or because it doesn&#8217;t load. That&#8217;s the thing that should take the place of that image. And that&#8217;s the generic version of it because the things stored in the media library is just one alternative text. So usually that is going to be a description of the image. In actual use, you may or may not want to use that text depending on the context. Again, with that linked image, it&#8217;s not necessarily a description of it. It might be a description of the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the caption, the caption is a thing that should be universally available. So both people who are sighted and people who are visually impaired will be able to see that. So really it&#8217;s something that should be complimentary to the image. It gives additional context, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily explicitly describe it. An example there would be, it might be used to say who is in the image. For example, you know, the description is a man with glasses and a beard, stroking a cat. And then the caption actually says, this is a picture of our founder, Joe Dolson and his cat Bubbles. I don&#8217;t have a cat named bubbles. just to be clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] Nathan Wrigley: There was more in that than I, I imagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] Joe Dolson: The description field is actually not used by default unless your theme has decided that there&#8217;s some context in which that&#8217;s used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:09] Nathan Wrigley: So, okay, we&#8217;ve done one and two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] Joe Dolson: Moving on to number three. That&#8217;s form fields without labels. And that is an incredibly big deal. I mean, if you have a contact form or a search form or a sales form, any kind of query, and those form fields don&#8217;t have labels, then basically a user with a screen reader, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re trying to do. They have no idea what this is. Frequently, you have form fields that have text nearby that is visually a label, it looks like it has a label. But if there&#8217;s no explicit association between that information, because a label is a specific HTML field and it&#8217;s connected to an input using a for attribute and an ID, attribute. And that makes it really straightforward, really explicit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that tells somebody what this field is for. And those being missing are just, that&#8217;s just wrong. It should not be missing. Next one after that, and I&#8217;m just gonna collapse the next two into one because they&#8217;re effectively the same problem. Empty links and empty buttons. That is literally a link that does not have any text contained inside it, or a button that doesn&#8217;t have any text. As often as not that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re either an image that doesn&#8217;t have an alt attribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s nothing meaningful there. It&#8217;s like a font icon or an SVG image that is supposed to represent your hamburger menu, or it&#8217;s a close icon, or it&#8217;s a help icon or any of those many possibilities, but doesn&#8217;t have any kind of accessible name. It doesn&#8217;t have any attributes that give that a text context. So the screen reader knows what this is supposed to do. Those are also extremely common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last of the six, and this is quite rare to be a problem on a WordPress site because WordPress pretty much takes care of this, is a missing document language. Every HTML element should have a lang attribute that declares what language the document is in. English, German, French, Spanish, whatever. And the purpose of that for a screen reader is to tell them how to pronounce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having that means it will be pronounced according to whatever that person&#8217;s local settings are. So if they&#8217;re a French browser on an English site, the English is gonna have a very strong accent. And in fact, it&#8217;s not really an accent because it&#8217;s following a completely different set of pronunciation rules and that&#8217;s going to make it incomprehensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So making sure that that attribute is present is really important. I haven&#8217;t seen that as a problem on a WordPress site with a theme that&#8217;s reasonably recent for a long time. There were definitely a lot of older themes where, big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that the six things that you brought to the table could easily be 15, 20 things, but six was the number that was chosen there. I guess the problem is you could have gone on all day and we could have talked for hours about all the other things, but these are the things that have risen to the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anybody who&#8217;s not encountered this is now going to be presented with additional things to do. Work to be undertaken. Things to be learned and so on and so forth. I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any, any useful things, tools for want of a better word that you have found over the years that have enabled you to short circuit things, make things as easy as possible. So it might be a browser extension, or I don&#8217;t know, some app that you can install on your computer or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] Joe Dolson: Yes, there are an incredible number of these types of tools, and they all have slightly different ways of working, slightly different sets of tests. But these particular six items, all of the automated tests are going to find these and help you solve them. They&#8217;ll give you guidance about what you have and what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think some of the ones I use the most are going to be, there&#8217;s an automated tester from tenon.io, and that&#8217;s an application that you can run remotely. It&#8217;s got an API, you can run it just automatically. And it&#8217;ll just scan a page and give you a list of everything it&#8217;s found on it..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is wave.webaim.org. That&#8217;s from the same group of people who produced this report that found these errors. And that&#8217;s available as a toolbar for, I think it&#8217;s Chrome. Firefox or Edge, so pretty broadly available. It&#8217;s also testing one page at a time, but they do have a tool through a company called Pope Tech, that can give you generated reports of larger sets of pages. So you can get a much larger body of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are browser extensions from an organization called Deque called Axe. Those also do a wide variety of automated tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that&#8217;s important in development with accessibility is that it&#8217;s always something that needs to be based on the rendered site. There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re called the web content accessibility guidelines. It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s all about the user experience and what they&#8217;re actually getting. So there aren&#8217;t a lot of tools for doing like pre-production linting as part of your development. You know, you can do some of that in an end to end test, but it&#8217;s going to be very limited because it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so many assumptions you have to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the real world is where people have put in content that, the content is what&#8217;s really causing problems. Anything with these images, almost all of that is problems coming from content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] Nathan Wrigley: So it strikes me from what you&#8217;ve just said, that there might be a better place to put this work. This work that needs to be done in the workflow of a typical website. And from what you&#8217;ve just said, it sounds like it would be better done toward, the end of the development cycle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:43] Joe Dolson: Different parts of it fall in different locations. So low contrast text, for example, is frequently a design issue. So that as often as not should go at the very, very beginning. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re deciding what kind of color palette you&#8217;re going to use and what your base design looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The images, it&#8217;s a mix, because it depends on whether you&#8217;re using a plugin that generates a body of images, or you&#8217;re using images embedded into content. In the latter case, it&#8217;s a content production issue. So it&#8217;s something that you should be checking on the fly and should be done on a constantly recurring basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the application environment, for, you know, a plugin that&#8217;s producing these lists. That needs to be fixed in the development side, on that plugin of whatever it&#8217;s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Form fields are another one where most of that needs to come from the plugin that&#8217;s generating your form. Gravity Forms has done a huge amount of work on improving the accessibility of their product. They&#8217;ve got more to do. It&#8217;s always, these things are a constant battle of, oh, we screwed this up now we&#8217;ve gotta fix it. Oh, we fix this, but now we screwed that up. But Gravity Forms has done a really great job, and one of the advantages to that is that they don&#8217;t give you a lot of room to screw it up. Just make sure that legacy markup is not turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] Nathan Wrigley: There&#8217;s a whole other conversation I think to be had there as well, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of a typical agency, let&#8217;s say who&#8217;s done none of this work before. They&#8217;ve got a legacy of websites. Let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, 50 websites, which they&#8217;re maintaining and they&#8217;ve built. So suddenly we are presenting the agency with work that they need to go back, and if you like retro fit the websites that they&#8217;ve already built and bring them up to standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, there&#8217;s gonna be the new work which comes through the door and that&#8217;s gonna be a little bit more straightforward. This brings to mind the question, how much do we need to be doing of this now? How imperative is it for us to go back to our clients and say, look, we need to begin this work yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is it more a case going back to the clients and saying, maybe it&#8217;s time to begin again. And I know that&#8217;s not gonna be a comfortable conversation to have. Essentially what I&#8217;m trying to say, is it easy to retrofit or is it sometimes easy just to begin again almost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:55] Joe Dolson: It is absolutely frequently easier to begin again. But it&#8217;s it is very much a case by case scenario. One of the things about the WordPress environment and this ecosystem, is that there&#8217;s a huge number of themes and plugins that you&#8217;re building your sites based on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those themes and plugins are issuing updates and they&#8217;re fixing problems, then a lot of the problems that are coming out of those tools can be fixed for you. And I mean that&#8217;s why I think the people who should be looking at this first and foremost are the tool creators. WordPress Core, plugin authors, theme authors, because that is going to solve the biggest, most global problems. And when I say global, I mean, these are things that are infecting, that are affecting entire sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, infecting. It&#8217;s kind of an interesting perspective, I like that in some ways, I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re infected with inaccessibility. But anyway, if these plugins can fix something then they can have an impact on thousands, millions of sites. I mean this is one of the reasons I contributed to WordPress at all is if I can make one little change, it can potentially impact millions of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] Nathan Wrigley: Just the answer to this may simply be a no, and it goes nowhere else. But is there any sort of an accreditation system that things like plugins can get certified against. So that, for example, you mentioned Gravity Forms as a good example of a company that have done some work in that area. So that you could visit their website, see the accreditation stamp somewhere and say, okay, I&#8217;m assured that at least some of the work has been done. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:31] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s nothing that I&#8217;m aware of really for plugins. There&#8217;s an organization. It&#8217;s the IAAP, the international association of accessibility professionals. Uh, and they certify people as specialists. In the theme world the WordPress theme repository does have the accessibility ready tag that does require some manual testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are a really difficult case because it&#8217;s hard to set a specific set of tests and guidelines that they have to meet because they do so many different things. For some plugins, there are no settings, there&#8217;s no user interface, it just does some automation. And you&#8217;re like, well, is that accessible? It literally has no interface. How do we judge that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:14] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so, we talked about retrofitting. We talked about beginning and potentially that the beginning is the easiest way to go forward. That therefore raises the question of how much of this do you need to be mindful of before you can say, that site is ready to ship. And bluntly let&#8217;s say, is it okay to have a site where 10% of the tick list that you want to achieve has been completed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that okay to launch, or do we need to be higher into the fifties, or indeed the nineties, or the 100%? In other words, is it better to do something and launch it, rather than wait until it&#8217;s perfect? We know how this works. If we build websites, we&#8217;ve had this problem time and again. You know, things creep in that we need to do, and we never end up launching the product because we&#8217;re constantly, constantly making it perfect. So just some guidance on where we need to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:05] Joe Dolson: So it&#8217;s a slightly different answer depending on whether we&#8217;re building a new product or making changes and retrofitting something old. When you&#8217;re retrofitting, in my opinion, it&#8217;s just, the goal is make it better every day. If you can ship an update that fixes one problem, then fix that one problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s better. It doesn&#8217;t have to go from zero to a hundred in an instant. There&#8217;s no reason to wait. To shift an improvement. When it&#8217;s a new product I would say 10% is awfully low, because we all know how priorities work And as soon as that product gets in front of users. Now you&#8217;ve got user demands. You&#8217;ve got clients who just are like, oh, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know that I want to pay anything more right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that additional percentage may just never happen. So going over 10% is definitely worthwhile. But you should always recognize that there is no a hundred percent. Like you&#8217;re not going to achieve a hundred percent accessibility. The range of human experience and human perception is far too great. All you can reach for is try and think of everything you can, and everything that seems reachable and that you understand and recognize that you&#8217;re going to make mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:20] Nathan Wrigley: You were mentioning earlier about the lawyering and how that has become a thing. And I&#8217;m wondering who is the person who&#8217;s responsible. So in other words, if you are the web designer and you&#8217;ve taken on that work and you&#8217;ve handed over to your client, but then they&#8217;ve taken over for example, and they&#8217;re maintaining and updating from this moment forward. Is there any guidance around that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, can you insulate yourself from the problems which may occur? And again, there&#8217;s a myriad set of different ways that we could build and hand over and all of those kind of things, but, I&#8217;m sure a lot of people listening to this will be thinking, okay, how can I protect myself, having done some of it, but not all of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:58] Joe Dolson: This is definitely one of the areas where that gap in regulation is a real problem. In terms of responsibility that ultimately falls on the business owner, the website owner, or the product owner. But of course, the terms of your contract will vary and your specific liability to the outcome of your product might vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even in the most solidly constructed contract where you protect yourself, that doesn&#8217;t mean you couldn&#8217;t be sued for negligence. You know these things all revolve around. If a company ends up having to pay damages of $7 million because of an inaccessible website, it&#8217;s very reasonable to think they&#8217;re gonna go back to the people who they hired to work on that website and be like, we are not happy. I think that&#8217;s an extremely justified position to be in. So I think everybody needs to take a piece of this responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for a fact that, in the Ontario law, the AODA, they do explicitly specify that everything on the website has to be accessible, including third party products that you are using. So a common problem in a lot of websites that I&#8217;ve audited, you know, it&#8217;s a nonprofit, they&#8217;ve got a great accessible website, but they&#8217;re using this client relationships, module, a CRM to take their donations, and it&#8217;s a mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re like, okay, this is an absolutely key part of keeping your organization operating, is getting these donations working and that&#8217;s not accessible. So you really do have a problem there. And that&#8217;s a third party application. You don&#8217;t have any direct control over it. You can&#8217;t directly fix it, and I think that&#8217;s a marketplace problem. Where all of these elements within the overall picture have to be thinking about what their responsibility is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:50] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re obviously very keen on this. And I&#8217;m just wondering if this is becoming an industry. In other words, a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have SEO experts. Well, quite a long time ago now, but let&#8217;s say 20 years ago, there was no such thing as an SEO expert. It just, wasn&#8217;t a thing. Now there is. There&#8217;s people who you would hire in because you want to take over the SEO and give it to somebody else. And that&#8217;s now their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a growing collection of people like yourself, who you can hire in to examine and look, so you&#8217;re not relying on the tools, the automated tools. You&#8217;re really getting a, a human being in to do the real work, and yeah, is there a career there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] Joe Dolson: Oh, absolutely. It is actually a huge growing market. I think the growth of the accessibility consulting and testing market is pretty high. I don&#8217;t know what it is right now off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s a growth market with no question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as somebody who&#8217;s been in accessibility for almost 20 years, there&#8217;s always been an industrial market for accessibility. 20 years ago, it was almost exclusively in government, universities, higher ed, that sort of area. And it has been growing very rapidly. There are a lot of large companies now that they exclusively provide accessibility consulting. There&#8217;s actually been a lot of consolidation and acquisition within the accessibility space. So there&#8217;s no question that this is absolutely a major career. It&#8217;s a market where if you engage in some training and accessibility, there are jobs to be had. They are all hiring, and this is because it has grown enormously in the last four or five years,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:31] Nathan Wrigley: Which brings me to nearly my last question, and that is, imagine that we&#8217;re working for a large agency and we are employed by a boss who, how to put this, does not care about the last half an hour&#8217;s conversation that we&#8217;ve had. And just simply wants to ship things as quickly as possible, and obviously what you are proposing is not as quickly as possible. There&#8217;s other work that needs to be done on top of that. So we could hire out, we could find somebody such as yourself, who&#8217;s able to guide us with our, your expertise. But, what do we say to those bosses? How do we persuade them that, not only does this matter, but it&#8217;s essential?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] Joe Dolson: So I think, you know, some people are unpersuadable. There are always going to be a group of people for whom this is simply not, not something they are going to choose to care about. And those people will ultimately only be persuaded by legal action. And so when their company gets sued, they will have no choice but to deal with that. But operating on the assumption that we&#8217;re working with somebody who at least is willing to listen to reason and to, justifications about why this needs to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of arguments in favor of it, in terms of the fact that it makes websites easier to use. It makes processes easier for customers. So there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s an acquisition aspect. There&#8217;s a sales benefit. Just making things easier to use, making things possible to use by more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an estimate of around 15% of the world population has some form of disability that could impact their experience on the web. And a lot of that is in cognitive impairments, where they might have problems with distraction, or lack of focus, short term memory loss, and all of those people are going to benefit enormously from the same kinds of principles that go into web accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on a, on a marketing argument, the very fact that by implementing accessibility, you can increase your potential market by 15% is something that should be relevant. I think there is a perception sometimes that people with disabilities aren&#8217;t a market with money to spend. That&#8217;s a bias that&#8217;s coming through things like, the social security programs for supporting people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fact is, in this era the percentage of people with disabilities who are able to be gainfully employed is rapidly increasing because the digital marketplace takes away a lot of the barriers. You don&#8217;t have to necessarily travel to your job, which might be very difficult if you are visually impaired. Or if you have problems with distraction in an environment, or you just need to be able to get away from over stimulation. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that market is increasing. I think, I think it&#8217;s the US number right around now. I happen to do a presentation on Thursday morning about accessible advertising. So a lot of these numbers are things that I&#8217;m remembering from my presentation two days ago, that the estimated buying power of the US disability, people with disabilities, is around 350 billion. But an awfully high number of products cannot be purchased by those people, because they&#8217;re not accessible. There&#8217;s an awful lot of people with disabilities where I buy from this company. Why? Because it&#8217;s the only one I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:58] Nathan Wrigley: That is absolutely fascinating. And it really speaks to the question that I asked. If you have a boss who doesn&#8217;t care, potentially this is the quickest route to somebody caring. There is a market, it&#8217;s a growing market. You can be more profitable by making these tweaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final question if that&#8217;s okay? We&#8217;ve talked about a lot. There&#8217;s probably gonna be a lot of confusion about where do I go, how do I find out more about these things? And you&#8217;ve sent me, we had a little shared show notes, and you&#8217;ve sent me a bunch of links. It&#8217;s gonna be difficult for us to spell them all out. I will put every link in the show notes and hopefully get them done correctly. Do you just wanna say something about the best places, the most reliable, the quickest wins, if you like that you have come across where people could? I don&#8217;t know, two or three or four of them that you&#8217;re happy to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:41] Joe Dolson: So yeah, I mean the list of people I&#8217;ve mentioned, they all have unique perspectives and great information. I always recommend when you&#8217;re trying to get the current best practices on how things really work and what is, what support is available for a particular interaction interface. I like to go to Adrian Roselli. He&#8217;s very, very thorough researcher on accessibility issues. And one of the best things about what he publishes is that he routinely updates things. So his website does not have stale content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that absolutely. I haven&#8217;t read everything on his site. It might have stale content, but I&#8217;m not aware of it. So that&#8217;s a great place because you can trust that it&#8217;s going to be current and maintained and is very thorough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like Haydon Pickering and Scott O&#8217;Hara. That might be O&#8217;Hara. I honestly don&#8217;t know. They both do a lot of nitty gritty experimental of, this is how you use these various accessible interactions. They&#8217;re great resources. And then there&#8217;s a general website, it&#8217;s the A11Y project, the accessibility project. And that publishes articles by a lot of very experienced accessibility practitioners who&#8217;ve been around for a long time, who are new to the industry, but writing really solid information about how things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course there&#8217;s the actual WCAG documentation. There&#8217;s a lot of information from the web accessibility initiative, the WAI working group, and they have an enormous amount of information about just general, what it means to be accessible and what an accessible interface looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:25] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:26] Joe Dolson: Ha, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:27] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays have cropped up. Essentially what we&#8217;re dealing with here is a, click a button, I will solve all of your website accessibility needs. That sounds too good to be true. It sounds too simple to be able to install something, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a plugin or a piece of JavaScript or whatever it may be, and to say to yourself, I&#8217;m done. I am compliant. I&#8217;ve done all of the things by installing some small bit of code. Tell me your thoughts about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:54] Joe Dolson: Well, you know, if things seem too good to be true, it might be because they&#8217;re false. And that is absolutely the case with overlays. If an overlay is claiming, I&#8217;m going to solve your problems, you don&#8217;t need to think about anything else, you are now compliant, that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re lying to you. Flat out lying to you. Because what overlays are is they&#8217;re kind of a side effect of the accident chasing, legal thing. They&#8217;re a reaction of, oh, we have all this AI. We can solve things. We can find all these problems. It&#8217;s amazing. This is fabulous. But they can&#8217;t, because the problems are vastly more complex than they actually think they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many things simply, you can&#8217;t even test to identify the problem, let alone fix it. So overlays are basically just a disaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:44] Nathan Wrigley: Is there any scenario in which they represent a decent bridge? In other words if, if you just click that button, get that overlay on there, and then begin the good work that you&#8217;ve described during the podcast, all the other things that you can do. Is there any scenario where that could be recommended? Knowing that it was the temporary kludge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] Joe Dolson: Mostly, no. Now I will say that&#8217;s a no in terms of any of the really major overlay vendors, because for the most part, they are actually going to make your website worse. There are certain of those vendors who will absolutely, definitely make it worse. And there are browser extensions that have been marketed directly to the disability community for the sole reason of disabling these overlays because of the problems they cause for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some extremely narrow categories where an overlay can bridge that, and a lot of the major accessibility corporations as part of their work, they will build an overlay, a custom overlay, which specifically deals with specific problems on your website. And that&#8217;s going to be in cases where the process to actually get the backend code updated is too burdensome, and they need something fast. But it&#8217;s only gonna solve a tiny fraction of those problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should be something that&#8217;s custom, that&#8217;s targeted. I have a plugin, WP Accessibility. It includes some overlay aspects within it, but they are very targeted because they are targeted at specific things that are known to happen with WordPress or with WordPress themes, and they have known answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even then, I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s something that guaranteed to fix everything. It could still cause problems. And you shouldn&#8217;t keep it installed and operating in that manner any longer than you absolutely have to, because fundamentally what you need to do is get the fix in place But these big commercial overlays are just horrendous. They make things worse, period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:44] Nathan Wrigley: There was one further question. Sorry, I was sneaking this one in right at the end. I also asked you to recommend a community that you thought was worth hanging out in, because that&#8217;s often a way to just sort of speed up the process. You find some friends in there and they help you and they point you in the right direction. So, you&#8217;ve mentioned one here. Do you just wanna tell us about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:01] Joe Dolson: So there&#8217;s a Slack community for web accessibility professionals. It&#8217;s web-a11y.slack.com, and there&#8217;s about 10,000 members of that Slack organization. And it&#8217;s a great place to ask questions, look for advice, read what other people have done, search for past conversations on various topics. It&#8217;s a pretty large Slack. It&#8217;s very active. It&#8217;s kind of the place where the community mostly hangs out I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:32] Nathan Wrigley: And should anybody wish to find you Joe, off the back of this. If you&#8217;re willing to share, what are the best places to get in touch with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:39] Joe Dolson: I&#8217;d say the best places for me, you can find me on Twitter @joedolson, J O E D O L S O N. You can find me in the WordPress Slack, also Joe Dolson. Pretty much anywhere I am, you&#8217;ll find me as Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much for joining us on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:56] Joe Dolson: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer, and a web accessibility consultant. He’s part of the Make WordPress Accessible team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled ‘<a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Finding and Fixing the Six Most Common WCAG 2 Failures</a>’, highlights some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>low contrast text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing alternative text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty links</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing form labels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing document language</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed, as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues, and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Joe’s opinion that you’re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there’s an ever growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity, so now might be the time to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market which claim that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there’s real work to be done on each website as they’re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joedolson\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s Twitter account</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/\">Adrian Roselli&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tink.uk/\">Leonie Watson&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/\">Heydon Pickering&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/\">Scott O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/\">The a11y Project</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web-a11y.slack.com/\">a11y Slack channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">axe accessibility testing tool</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/\">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tenon.io/\">Tenon.io</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pope.tech/\">popetech web accessibility testing &amp; reporting</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webaim.org/\">webAIM website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">The WebAIM Million report</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/\">International Association of Accessibility Professionals: IAAP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aoda.ca/\">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Tumblr Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=63462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2022/09/tumblr-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:888:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/staff/696482214233440256/introducing-community-labels-as-you-know-art-and\">Tumblr launched Community Labels yesterday</a>, which allows consistent tagging of addiction, violent, and adult content, and for people to hide, blur, or show that content.

For example, if a customer is purchasing a new gardener&#8217;s kit, the store may cross-sell gardening gloves as a complementary product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new feature is only available to users in the cart, as the idea is to catch the customer at the moment of buying and encourage them to purchase additional products. These are not simply best-selling products but rather are carefully curated to be specific to the item in the cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells will show up beneath the cart&#8217;s contents automatically after the store owner identifies them in the product&#8217;s &#8220;linked products&#8221; setting. At the moment, cross-sells are limited to two rows of three products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells show up near the bottom of the cart page before the customer clicks to checkout. This seems like it is squeezed into a crowded place as an afterthought. If you want to make the cross-sells more prominent or change where they appear on the page, it is possible but requires a few extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> is like the Gutenberg plugin for WooCommerce &#8211; it&#8217;s a feature plugin that serves as a place to iterate and test new blocks, and get access to bleeding edge features. With this plugin installed, you can <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/using-the-new-block-based-checkout/\">enable the block-based cart</a> by deleting the cart shortcode on the cart page and adding the Cart block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells now appear in the block-based cart but it is locked in place and cannot be moved up or down on the page. If you want to customize this block further, you must uncheck the boxes that are disabling movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the Cross-Sells block, I found that it is still very limited in how it can be customized. The current experience of this block seems more like a placeholder and it could definitely benefit from more customization options, such as background color options, width adjustment, and the ability to change how the individual products inside the box are displayed. Right now it only has one option to set the number of cross-sells products to display. I was able to move the block to the top of the cart page but could not do much more with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce team has requested feedback on the new block and will continue to iterate on it. Version 6.8.0 of WooCommerce Blocks also adds half a dozen fixes and improves compatibility with <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/woopay-customer-documentation/\">WooPay</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 04:06:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Publishes Schedule Ahead of Virtual Event October 11-13, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138202\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-publishes-schedule-ahead-of-virtual-event-october-11-13-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1825:\"<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\">WooSesh</a>, a virtual conference for WooCommerce professionals and store builders, has published the schedule for the upcoming three-day event beginning on October 11.

Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-beta2.zip\">Beta 2 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-beta2</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is November 1, 2022, which is about five weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-1/\">6.1-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks detailing all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress bug-free – help with testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. This detailed guide is an excellent start if you have never tested a beta release before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps ensure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. Anyone can take part in testing – especially great WordPress community members like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core.

The theme puts the spotlight on food photography offset with bold typography featuring the Playfair Display font for headings and Source Sans Pro for paragraph text. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Truong is working on setting up a marketing site for the theme so there is no demo at this time. One drawback is that it does not include any full-page patterns where you can quickly build a homepage or menu page without having to think about how the design should go together. You will have to rely on your own sense of design but Molten comes packaged with ample patterns for building pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molten has four different hero patterns, three &#8220;coming soon&#8221; patterns, and six &#8220;call to action&#8221; patterns in various layouts (media and text, full width cover with text and button, and three columns with images and content). The theme also comes with a large gallery block pattern and multiple location pattern designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s almost nothing worse than a restaurant website that makes you download a PDF menu. It&#8217;s not mobile or SEO-friendly, and downloading a separate file is a terrible user experience. Restaurateurs have traditionally used PDFs because it&#8217;s easier to update it by uploading and replacing the old files. It&#8217;s also easier to design it to approximate the printed menu. Blocks can make it easier for restaurants to abandon this practice of using PDFs. A block-based menu can be quickly edited and expanded as necessary without messing with uploading any files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molten includes four Menu block patterns with different layouts for wine lists, dishes, and pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p> Molten packages nine templates and five template parts for users who want to dig into full-site editing. There are multiple light and dark footer and header designs, search, archive, a completely blank template, and more. It includes four style variations which can significantly change the mood of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the theme has just about anything a restaurant or &#8220;coming soon&#8221; establishment may need in terms of layout and design. The default color palette has a simple black and white typography-forward design that puts the emphasis on the food. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/molten/\">Molten</a> is available for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 04:03:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Do The Woo Community: WordPress Translation Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72945\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://dothewoo.io/wordpress-translation-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:356:\"<p>Every year WordPress has a Translation Day.

This is accomplished using <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (WASM), a format for a stack-based virtual machine that enables deployment on the web for client and server applications, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://emscripten.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Emscripten</a>, an open source compiler toolchain to WebAssembly. It&#8217;s not stable yet but the concept is intriguing, as it opens up a world of potential use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: demo from <a href=\"https://github.com/adamziel/wordpress-wasm\">wordpress-wasm</a> repo\n\n\n\n<p>The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/adamziel/wordpress-wasm\">available on GitHub</a> and Zielinski briefly explained how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>PHP is compiled to WASM with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://emscripten.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Emscripten</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress is packaged into a data bundle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A service worker traps HTTP requests and re-routes them to WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The project uses the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db\" target=\"_blank\">wp-db-sqlite</a> plugin to run WordPress with SQLite, as WASM doesn&#8217;t support MySQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zielinski detailed some possible applications for running WordPress in the browser, which he said could &#8220;transform learning, contributing, and using WordPress:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> making WordPress handbook code samples runeditable (<a href=\"https://adamziel.github.io/tutorial.html\">early preview</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>providing an in-browser IDE to assist new contributors without having without having to set up a local development environment (<a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/edit/wp-plugin-playground\">early preview</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>creating an in-browser IDE for testing code on different WordPress, PHP, and Gutenberg versions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>scaling WordPress up by spinning up many tiny self-contained WASM instances directly on the edge servers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>embedding a demos of a plugin, pattern, or theme (example: <a href=\"https://wpreadme.com/\">wpreadme.com</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>importing an existing WordPress website into WASM runtime to create a staging website</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototypes are in their very early stages and have a few limitations right now. The block editor works but not the site editor, and the sites in the browser cannot communicate with WordPress.org to fetch plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zielinski is eager to recruit contributors to help build out this vision and make it a reality. It&#8217;s quite an undertaking but the benefits contributors and developers stand to gain from having the ability to instantly spin up an in-browser IDE for WordPress are enormous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Learning WordPress and writing code used to be separated,&#8221; Zielinski said regarding using Stackblitz to create more interactive docs. &#8220;Now they can be one and the same. From runnable code snippets to new, svelte-like docs formats, <a href=\"https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/\">WebContainers</a> + WebAssembly WordPress is an educational game-changer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more technical details on how this works, check out Zielinski&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/23/client-side-webassembly-wordpress-with-no-server/\">post</a> and click through to the various demos.

It is the first block theme to meet the requirements for gaining this distinction. During its development the theme was also tested and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/issues/82\">found to meet WCAG AA level accessibility requirements</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag can be applied to themes in the directory that have successfully completed an accessibility audit for the minimum requirements established by the Themes team. Theme authors are encouraged to exceed those requirements, which are laid out in a tiered set of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/recommended/\">recommended</a> guidelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that themes tagged as accessibility-ready do not necessarily meet <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/make/which-questions-should-you-ask/#levels-of-accessibility\">any level of formal accessibility requirements</a>, as those measurements apply to content and cannot be applied to a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the tag added to Twenty Twenty-Two was delayed due to a few issues that required collaboration across teams. One of the important ones was the theme having <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/issues/233\">multiple H1 headings</a> per page. Although WCAG guidelines do not prohibit more than one H1 on a page, the <code>accessibility-ready</code> guidelines required no more than one H1 per page. Some participants in the discussion suggested that the requirements needed to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason the theme accessibility-ready guidelines are stricter than WCAG is mostly for clarity: the guidelines were written to be easily testable and explicit,&#8221; Accessibility Team contributor Joe Dolson commented on the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The point being that we couldn&#8217;t provide extensive accessibility training to theme reviewers, so we needed the rules to be as narrow as possible. As long as we update the guidelines in a way that still meets that criteria, I think it would be fine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes and Accessibility teams reached a consensus on how the accessibility-ready tag will apply to block themes so contributors could move forward with adding the tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We should keep in mind that a breakage to the accessibility of WordPress block output will impact all block themes, so those failures are quite serious, but as it stands now the theme meets all expected criteria,&#8221; Dolson <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55172#comment:47\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Themes Directory currently has just 94 themes tagged as &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a>&#8221; and only two of them also have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready+full-site-editing/\">support for full-site editing</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/jace/\">Jace</a> by Themes Team contributor Carolina Nymark, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/w3csspress/\">W3CSSPress</a> by Matteo Marchiori.

Far from it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the partnerships Atarim has forged with <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/atarim-and-mainwp-partner-up/\">MainWP</a></strong> and now <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/atarim-and-rocket-net-partnership/\">Rocket.net</a></strong> after <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/agency-business-brief-for-the-week-of-september-12/\">a funding round</a> from <strong>Automattic</strong>, <strong>Newfold</strong>, and <strong>Yoast</strong>&#8216;s founders, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress founders investing in WordPress founders will grow the market without mergers thinning out the ecosystem\'s biodiversity. <strong>GridPane</strong>&#8216;s founder and CEO <strong>Patrick Gallagher</strong> said <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/agency-business-brief-for-the-week-of-september-12/\">their funding round</a> was &#8220;incredibly company-friendly because we\'ve retained 100% control of the business and its direction.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or take the <strong>Gravity Forms</strong> ecosystem cultivating its own extension and services market, encouraging members of their own team to start businesses in that space (<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/\">way back in 2015</a>) and then <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/what-does-professionalism-mean-in-wordpress/\">bringing them back under Gravity\'s wing</a> years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of ways to grow on your own terms in WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all partnerships are about the direct exchange of dollars either. At WCUS I had a number of conversations about informal partnerships between hosting companies to deal with <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/open-secrets-forced-updates-in-wordpress/\">security issues</a>, fraudsters, piracy, and other potential spoilers in the commons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a unique and powerful way to sustain the Open Web —</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Independence through partnership. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth by traveling together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 07:58:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Post Status: The Ellipsis Weather Report is Live\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=123427\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://poststatus.com/the-ellipsis-weather-report-is-live/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3743:\"<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Every week, Ellipsis\' Weather Report will show how much WordPress and WooCommerce search and advertiser activity has increased or dropped relative to the previous week.

It\'s showing two live trendlines for WordPress and WooCommerce. The data can be downloaded, and there\'s more information about Ellipsis\' methodology available now, which has been reviewed by Dr. Oliver Crook, at the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. “Using aggregation of market data and bimonthly median smoothing, Ellipsis gives a robust estimate of the current state of the WordPress market,” according to Dr. Crook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\'s Being Measured?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellipsis processes and stores data on tens of thousands of WordPress and WooCommerce keywords to power their FALCON AI. Data points they include are keyword metrics, advertiser activity, performance metrics, and rich data around URLs in the search results for each keyword. This data provides deep insight into what WordPress and WooCommerce solutions people are searching for on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ellipsis, &#8220;The score is <em>relative</em> to itself and calculated on a 4-week rolling basis.&#8221; Specifically, &#8220;The score each week is the 4-week rolling average of the blended search and advertiser activity data.&#8221; If you compare your own business and search trend analyses to the Weather Report trends, you\'ll see whether your data is in line with them — or higher or lower. The Weather Report trendlines are intended to serve WordPress businesses this way, as an orienting benchmark. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bringing New Data About WordPress to the WordPress Business Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’ve never had this insight before, and it is exciting and terrifying to bring this kind of &#8216;live\' view of the industry, to the industry,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;We’ve all enjoyed the comfort of an ever-growing ecosystem, and the Weather Report will show us the extent to which that does or doesn’t continue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 06:09:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Post Status: WordPress Community News Roundup for the Week of September 19, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=123198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-community-news-roundup-for-the-week-of-september-19-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5210:\"<div class=\"wp-container-5 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The Post Status Member Spotlight turns onto Tom Greenwood this week.

Ny is optimistic pay transparency will soon be the norm in US law. Dan is optimistic the WordPress community can make the changes it needs out of empathy and regard for others plus the motivation to build a high quality, professional workforce. They both close out this episode expressing gratitude for the WordCamp organizers and volunteers who made WCUS possible this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>If [an employer] can\'t afford not to operate without suspicion and distrust, what does that tell you?</p><cite><strong>Dan Knauss</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/pay-transparency-mutual-respect-and-the-community-we-need/\">Post Status Excerpt (No. 63) — Pay Transparency, Mutual Respect, and the Community We Need</a></li><li>Piccia Neri, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/salary-transparency-why-not/\">Salary Transparency: Why Not?</a></li><li>Michelle Frechette, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">Five Days Without a Shower</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://time.com/5023287/uber-threatened-journalist-sarah-lacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Executive Said the Company Would Spend ‘A Million Dollars’ to Shut Me Up</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/uber-says-it-was-hacked-by-teenage-hacker-gang-lapsus-1849554679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Says It Was Likely Hacked by Teenage Hacker Gang LAPSUS$</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-12 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"WP-Engine\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-column\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/pagely\">Pagely</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-Tier Managed WordPress hosting solutions for Enterprise, the Public Sector, and Media companies.

Get any rest after WordCamp US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, that following weekend. Yes. I think I slept the entire Saturday. How about you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I, I caught up a little bit cuz right? Both of us and other, other people from your team. Uh, man, we had some late night talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really great. I really enjoyed meeting Matt and Devin and Brian too. And I briefly got to talk to Teron too, but man, you guys have a big group, so I got a nice picture. Me and Allie got you all there against the mural, and wow there were so many people to talk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team is like so awesome. And. that was our first time meeting in person. And nobody re nobody thought that they were like, no, you all [00:01:00] like carry on like old friends. And I was like, well, it seems like we\'re old friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I know I kept forgetting that! That was the first time you all met too. And yeah, that\'s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s a good, good bunch of people. And like I said, on Twitter, it. I don\'t know, I don\'t, I don\'t feel that old, but I, I definitely, uh, younger, younger people, including, including you, who I think are just, it\'s great to see, um, young, diverse, cool team coming into, into WordPress, deeper and deeper and just loved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the conversations we had. Um, and just throughout the whole thing, probably the, the biggest thing for me was, um, the kind of information, the kind of things you learn, the kind of questions. And, um, I, don\'t getting, getting kind of a map. I, you know, I\'m, I\'m trying to figure out the map of the WordPress business ecosystem and the project mm-hmm as a whole understand the community and how [00:02:00] things work or don\'t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, that was, that was. Great way to, to really beef that up, validate some ideas, throw in new questions, throw some curves at me. Um, nice. What was your, what was your main takeaway? What got out of it most?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, so my main takeaway was the community is it\'s bigger than I can like even imagine. And like this word camp was smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, due to COVID restrictions. So I know they\'re usually way bigger than that. And it\'s just, I cannot wrap my mind around that because I was able to meet so many different people from so many different companies that do so many different things in WordPress. So it is to me like unfathomable, like just the, the sheer amount of people and then from different walks of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, I thought that was awesome. It was so nice meeting. So many people like, um, I really appreciated that. [00:03:00] Also, um, it was just the talks. They were so most of them were so like personable and the people like the speakers were so great. Like, I, I could tell that they took their time selecting really great speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm the content and the speakers were amazing. I have like, no complaints about that, that at all, it was definitely a tech conference where I felt comfortable sitting through like entire, you know, workshops and sessions because everything was just so interesting and it was relevant and, you know, it was really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, it really was. I, I they\'ve really got the, um, the, uh, presentation format down. Well, the live, um, transcription was really useful. I, I found myself, um, following that quite a lot. And, um, maybe cuz I, some of the time when I was multitasking a little bit, like what, what, what, what they say there or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] Yeah, that and, and just the screen. And so, yeah, no matter how far back you were, you could read or hear quite, quite well. So, um, I, I don\'t know how long that\'s been a, a feature, but I think it\'s pretty standard now and it\'s done. It\'s done great. Mm-hmm but, um, yeah. Other other accessibility things not, not so not so great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, no, no, no, not at all, but I\'m gonna let you take the lead on that, cuz I want you to explain your experience, which I was very angry about. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I wouldn\'t say I got angry about it. I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I was angry. It\'s okay. Reading more after</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> we, after we read Michelle\'s piece mm-hmm but um, well we\'ve Michelle Frette has, um, written for us before about her experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm accessibility and wrote a guide actually. It might be close to a year ago. [00:05:00] And after, after that, and we had been together at a, a post status retreat, I, I tended to think more of the things she wrote in there from her experience, from her standpoint. So mm-hmm, , I think. What\'s Michelle, what\'s it like for Michelle and you know, and I going into it, I wasn\'t sure quite what to expect, but when I was booking, I saw there was, um, an option for ADA rooms and I apparently didn\'t have that many of them mm-hmm and I thought, you know, I should see what, this is, what this experience is like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time, um, I\'ve, you know, you know, Situation a bit. I, I thought I\'d, I\'ve been trying to be more getting older and having a progressive, um, neuromuscular disease that lifelong has just been, you know, my feet are ankles and knees and like are, are, uh, not [00:06:00] so not so great. And on any, any kind of slick surface or anything, I I\'m always thinking about looking out for falling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And which I\'ve done probably more than the, the average. And, um, so having something to grab onto definitely. And like bathrooms is really thinking like, yeah, you know, I should quit pretending so much that I can hide this or, or get by and, um, trying to be trying to be more. Able to express need mm-hmm explain the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really puts your body out in the open to people and mm-hmm speakers. So I got that. I got that. I should, I should start experiencing this, cuz it\'s only gonna, there\'s only gonna be more ahead and it\'s a pretty, you know, it\'s a pretty mild cases. These things go. It\'s not, hopefully I\'ll never quite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] Walking, but it, it knocks your mobility down. I\'m able to run like I did as a, tried to, as a kid for decades. Mm-hmm and um, so I got in there and the, the guy at the, at the desk. Was acting kind of odd about it and saying, oh, do you really need the eat sweet? And I\'m feeling like kind of bad, cuz you know, I look like a picture of privilege and, and stuff like, uh, well I don\'t wanna take</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn\'t matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I, well, I don\'t know it well, I sure wouldn\'t wanna take it from someone else. Mm-hmm um, But I gathered pretty quickly from what he was saying that they didn\'t really want to give me that room. And I was like, well, you know, looked this a while back. So like, you should have something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, well, look, this is, and I had to explain myself, you know, cuz I, unless you\'re kind of watching me walk from a way off you, you still might not, you know, you might not pick up on it. I it\'s like, look, I, I [00:08:00] mainly just. Bathroom with grab bars and, you know, mm-hmm, something that\'s easier to get in and out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I think that should just be on everything. Just be on everything falls. Yeah. Falls in the home are like the highest cause of death and injury. I think I read that once and, um, you know, it, the odds are not good on slip, tunnel, surfaces and stuff, the older you get period. And, um, and it, what ended up happening was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>they kind of confessed that there was a big generator truck right outside the door of this room. What, and as it was actually a truck of the generator and an air conditioning unit cooling the entire, that entire building on the, in the resort, or I guess the one on the roof ConEd out or something. And it was loud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I mean it, maybe if you want like white noise or something, but it was. [00:09:00] You could cope and he\'s like, yo, go in there and stand there five minutes. See, see what you think. Come back if it\'s no good. And I was like, this doesn\'t sound good. And it\'s a long, long, long walk out. There\'s all these gates and little stairs and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had a hard time finding how to get over there and cutting across grass and parking lots and stuff. And I found, you know, this is crazy. This is it\'s. Ugly. Ridiculous noisy. And mm-hmm , um, at least it\'s ground floor. You walk in shower, but you know, and if this is the last one, some, maybe someone else needs this more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went right back and it\'s like, look, I\'ll, I just won\'t towel. I just want, I want, uh, grab bars. So I don\'t, you know, rip the towel bar, curtain bar out of the, out of the wall, which I mm-hmm, done. Um, , you know, they don\'t even put like friction, like the little things in the bottom of the tub or, you know, stuff to like, not much of my foot surface, especially [00:10:00] on the left stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doesn\'t touch the ground. I don\'t have much grip mm-hmm . Um, and he did, he just didn\'t touch that at all. Cuz they don\'t have that. And, and later on, you know, they, the smallest toilets in the world and I, I, oh God, in the course of the like low oh low. You you\'re doing a full squat there ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that should be illegal for us, for us being tall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me and Dan are super tall. We got to like, experience that. Don\'t worry, I\'ll grow a little more and catch you. Yeah. But that should be illegal for us because that was so uncomfortable. It was like doing a crab walk. Like what in the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I know. And, and the more I talk to other people and, you know, there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us are an aging group that have, you know, been in touching WordPress in some capacity for its entire lifespan and doing web stuff since the nineties, um, getting a little long in the tooth. Um, and there\'s just a lot of people, you know, we\'re not [00:11:00] how depends how you define disability, but he gets harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gets harder. Mm-hmm and those are all things where pain. Injury and age, um, don\'t, don\'t make any of that experience fun or easy or accessible. And so, yeah, that\'s what I learned. And I wrote a little about it and told Michelle I was gonna, and we both did and linked to each other, but her experience was as you know, um, much more intense one with the, you know, needing to, to get around with a scooter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. I. You, well, let me talk about you first. I wish you would\'ve said something to me because I would\'ve been your, um, I know you\'re very sweet, but I would\'ve been your yeller I would\'ve gone up there. Like why God I business that you guys could get? No, I wouldn\'t have been that bad, but I definitely would\'ve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would\'ve talked to him. I would, I wouldn\'t have yelled at them, but, um, I, I, I [00:12:00] understand. I take care of my disabled mom and she never likes as for help. So I understand how it is. I wish that we could come to like a place where we, you, we could get, um, you all more comfortable with that because I definitely do not mind helping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, my second thing I was gonna say is I\'m just, I\'m angry because I, I know, and it\'s not like, you know, it\'s not the person at the desk fault. It\'s just an, I don\'t know what you would call it, what, uh, what would be a microaggression to see someone and to not be able to see their disability. So assume they don\'t have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And I hate that and I hate that people are trained to do that. And I, I just, I hate that you\'re experience that. And I just also hate that that place just, it\'s just really wasn\'t equipped. Um, Very well for accessibility, like it list like even looking at Michelle\'s article and it\'s stuff that I didn\'t pay attention to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course I did not pay attention to, but a big thing was not having a way to like, wave your [00:13:00] hands or like hit the button to open the doors, like right. Michelle had to depend on like the doors of being open or someone opening the door for her. That\'s ridiculous in. You know, the stuff you think would be a quick fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m one of these people where I\'m at the point where I\'m tired of hearing excuses about it. I won\'t take my anger out on people, but. Things have to change. Like there\'s, there\'s no excuse for that. And I\'m disappointed. Like people tell me all the time, like you think California has this big utopia and I don\'t, I know California has many issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a big state. I know it has many issues, but it\'s like, it\'s disappointing to me to have places like that in a major city. Where accessibility is not like high, a high priority on their list. Like it was just like being back in South Carolina where they refused to make buildings accessible, put things, they say they\'re historical landmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it just, that makes me angry as well. So, oh yeah. I, yeah, I, I just, uh, I was very angry and, but also very sad to hear about these circumstances, especially, you know, when so many of our [00:14:00] community depends on accessibility. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Um, It really wouldn\'t take too much to get a minimum, um, accessibility standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I mm-hmm, in a lot of places or at least just, you know, improve some of the basic safety and utility there. Yeah. Doors, doors shouldn\'t be difficult for anybody. And, and, uh, there were a lot of things that were right. It just wasn\'t thought out. And mm-hmm I actually expect that from the west Western Canada is the same, you know, like Atlanta, just brawl mm-hmm I, I briefly looked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would I get on walk down to the train station? If you try to cross that highway there, there\'s like, there\'s no pedestrian. It\'s just, you wait for cars to, let you through. And then, um, you ring by two highways and then, uh, get on the train and shouldn\'t that go right to the airport. But Google is telling me no, there would be a big walk on the other end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, you know, I\'m I was trying to avoid Uber cuz they,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> [00:15:00] um, or terrible people. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yes as you a great experience there either, but yeah. They\'re hostility tech journalists like Sara Lacey some years back, I like okay. Never unionized cab company. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m starting to blood feud with them, by the way, I\'m still still going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m still, I\'m still angry. so</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yes. You had a, a, a racist comment made, uh, by your driver. Am I that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that not exactly. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. What was the, I get sideways into that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but, mm. I don\'t even know, like, I\'m not as, you know, something happens and you\'re really angry about it, but then as time goes by, you\'re not as angry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m still like pretty angry. Like I\'m still as angry as I was when it happened. But, uh, long story short, our Uber driver came to take us to the airport and it was very early in the morning and you know, it was [00:16:00] me and two of my coworkers were all people of color and, um, there was a white lady out there with us too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was only, that was just us. And she was, you know, standing around, waiting for her ride. We were waiting for ours, you know, just average stuff. And the driver came and the woman went up to the white woman, went up to the Uber and she was like, Hey, how you doing? She started putting her stuff in. And my coworker was like, oh, I think that\'s our Uber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she doesn\'t use Uber a lot. So she didn\'t have like a profile picture up. Um, so you know, the guy didn\'t, you know, he couldn\'t see. Who he was picking up and like, um, the guy I got out the car and was helping her with her luggage. And then he like, you know, my coworker was like, Hey, I think that\'s ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He didn\'t even get acknowledge her. At first, he, you know, responded to the lady. He was like, you\'re not so and so, and she said, no, my name is Soandso. And so he like got back in his car and he locked his doors. And like, we didn\'t know what was going on. So we just started going to the Uber. We were like, oh, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that was solved. Cuz she was like, oh, okay. And went back, you know, to where she was standing. And um, he locked his door and we were like, [00:17:00] uh, you know, confused. We were like, you know, you lock your door. Right. And. My other coworker was like, are you not about to? Cause we didn\'t realize what was going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\'s like, are you not about to take this to the airport? And he said, no, I\'m not taking you anywhere. And then he like slams on his gas, like we\'re by the car. So he could have run over our foot feet. He slams on his gas and he like peels out of there when he sees this us, like in like, it was like, we, you know, it took us a moment to register it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we were like, what just happened? Even the lady was like, what just happened? She was like, what is going on? And like, Um, my coworker who was closer a little closer than I was like, he was like, when we were like, you\'re not taking us, he was like, I\'m not taking you. I\'m not taking you people anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was, you know, along that line. So I was like, what? And like that was like some crazy old school racism that I usually would experience and like rural South Carolina. So I\'m like, I know I\'m not in San Diego being told I can\'t get up. Ride to the airport. And, you know, again, I know [00:18:00] racism is everywhere, racist people are everywhere, but, um, it was just, it was weird because it was so many people out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like he didn\'t care if he had witnesses. It was. And then it was just weird. And like, I wasn\'t, I was angry, but I was like, well, Uber is a major company. They are not gonna stand for this. They have a mission statement, which they, they do not allow discrimination and they refused to do anything because the driver said he didn\'t wanna take us because he was worried about COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the driver was not wearing a mask and the white lady, he wanted to take. Instead of us also did not have on the mask. So we were like, what? And we were like, well, why couldn\'t he tell us that? Why did he say he wasn\'t taking us? You know, you people anywhere, why did he slam on the brakes and almost run over our feet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why there, we were like, that made no sense. We just think he was mad because he saw the, just the name. And he was like, okay, you know, this name is not. Probably not urban. Let\'s go pick them up. And then that\'s not that wasn\'t the case. So, um, Uber refused to do anything about it. They said they weren\'t gonna do anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that driver is still out there probably still [00:19:00] discriminating against people and doing that and making his money through Uber. And that\'s why I have a blood feud against them. Now I am a hundred percent dedicated to the destruction of that company. I am praying on their down fall daily. their hack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. They hacked the other day. It made my day. I slept with a big smile on my face. I think I woke up with a smile on my face. Like I\'m dedicated to the, the destruction of that company, because it\'s one thing to have an ignorant person, but to stand behind them as a company. Oh no, yeah, no, no, no, no, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I I\'ve surpris, I\'m surprised over the years, they\'ve Sur they\'ve survived the blows to their brand and just the, the profit model is, you know, I\'m with the. Taxi drivers who blocked them. and, uh, yeah, it\'s just, it\'s super convenient. I did try it for the first time. I never installed the app, but I, um, I had to get out quicker than I expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I was waiting for room service that never came and the train thing, I couldn\'t [00:20:00] figure out how to do it on foot. Like a good urban. Mass transit it\'s like, okay, this will be, I know this works. Um, I wasn\'t, I wasn\'t able to get my, get direct calls to work though. Almost the whole time I was there. Um, oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You told me that Canadian phone plan switching over to something and anyway, yeah. There\'s all kinds of little things happen when you travel. I\'m glad the guy didn\'t make a, I thought he had said something too, but that\'s just, that\'s crazy. So did he pay for that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No, he okay, good. Yeah. Like we didn\'t pay for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the only comment he made was like, it was like the, you people, like we\'re not taking, if I I\'m one of those people, like, yeah. He\'s like, I\'m gonna take you people anywhere. like yeah. You people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. And so, um, knock in the door. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it was crazy. I\'ve. It\'s been a while since I\'ve experienced overt racism like that, you know, I\'m used to the little [00:21:00] passive Southern racism where they\'re like, oh, you know, just hurrying alone, alone when they see you coming and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was really crazy. And I couldn\'t believe, like, I just really couldn\'t believe he did that. Like I was like, dude, like, but like a scene Uber\'s response. I\'m like, he\'s probably done this a bunch of times. Like, like Uber did not care. Um, so it was. Very, I don\'t know. Yeah. I was angry. I\'m still angry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m not, I\'m not gonna let up on this either. Like every person I talk to, everything I write about, they\'re gonna know how horrible Uber is, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, sorry about that. And it not really a, well, I don\'t know that those, how, how we treat each other is especially at those kind of points of. You know, strangers interacting or people you have to interact with at a conference to get from point a to point B it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know it\'s part of it. It is kind of an [00:22:00] accessibility thing and it, and it feels the same way. Like, am I gonna be safe? Mm-hmm am I, you know, can I trust these what\'s going on here? Am I gonna be okay. Um, and the more vulnerable position you\'re in the worst, all that can. land on you. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ve thought about that, cuz you know, you, you know that, um, I\'m on a boot right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\'t, and then I have crutches cuz I hurt my foot and you know, the thought did PO pass my mind. It\'s like, what if that guy was like, He wasn\'t just like the passive racist. He was like the violent racist and saw me on a boot and like wanted to push me down or something like that. Right. And it\'s like, that\'s stuff, you know, there are lots of people who are disabled, who are people of color that probably, and not probably that have to deal with stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, that was another thought. Like, I I\'ve thought a lot about, you know, things. That I need to examine myself like as a person who, like I said, just because I take care of my disabled mom, [00:23:00] that doesn\'t mean that I\'m disabled and that I have to go through these things. So a lot of this was eye opening for me as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, I think that transportation, um, I kind of wrote about this. I think transportation being set up by either word camp or some of the organizations. Would\'ve um, would definitely help out. Mm. Um, especially for people who need accessible ways to get around, because, you know, if you do do. Uh, what, what would you call like a Uber Lyft and you request like accessibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if no, accessibility, uh, no drivers with accessible, like room are available, you know? Right. You just can\'t go. So I definitely think it\'s an accessibility issue and you know, people are awful. It\'s nothing we can do about that, but we can definitely like, you know, help out a little</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> bit more. That\'s definitely a tough one for, uh, Michelle has mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several times being discriminated against because of her scooter, which breaks down mm-hmm into like five pieces and will fit in a trunk, you know, how do you think it got there on a plane? You know? Yeah. But they will give her the, they will balk at that and act like they\'re gonna, [00:24:00] they can\'t take her. Um, there was most, most of the time I was jumping in a ride with someone else and people stayed together and kind of looked out for each other and that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s always a good thing, but mm-hmm yeah. What if you find yourself in a boot coming home late from a karaoke club and you can get some kind of treatment like that. And yeah, I did manage to Luren eye out to, uh, found a karaoke place where it was a good, real good show, but the, the list was too deep and</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Dan did not do my do it with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y\'all you see how he did me? It was, I was so upset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It was so loud. My voice was gone. Anyway. I would had to do. Um, whatever I was thinking yeah. Inappropriate to do the sex pistols at that point. But, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I like the sex pistols we could have done. See, we could agree on anything and like, we could have done that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Elton John. Yeah. And El John</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> than John. Yeah. Well, [00:25:00] okay. Next time we get together or one, um, word camp or any, any occasion we\'ll we\'ll try again. All right. I promise. Okay. Well, the other thing we wanted to talk about was the, the transparency article by PCHA and Mary, um, which I\'ve been looking forward to publishing for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm , it\'s really long. It\'s awesome. I couldn\'t bear to cut it down. I may have even made it longer. but it it\'s worth it\'s worth the 20, 30 minute thinking through, I learned. From it because it\'s, it\'s exhaustive. She, she went through, she went through our job board on, on post status and we have a long, you, a long history of thinking about this sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have lots of awesome employers who post, you know, all the jobs on there gonna be good. But, um, some people probably, probably most don\'t don\'t post a salary range or anything like that. And which use, oh, very easy to do. [00:26:00] WP job manager plug in, um, caters to that as a feature. Um, why not? Why don\'t you put in a salary range, at least a range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, that was a question she took to the people who don\'t do it. I think she also, she also talked with people who do, and she got all the reasons for and against, and then gave shared those, you know, not trying to shame or blame anyone. Totally respectful and no one just been no flack or anything like that over, it\'s not WP drama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a real issue that\'s coming legally. Um, and I know there\'s European and, and state by state us legislation about it. Not really where in Canada, it\'s more common to, I know it\'s more common to see it here, especially around government, uh, jobs or nonprofit sector sometimes. Good, good. Um, It\'s it\'s [00:27:00] interesting what people say about why they don\'t, um, disclose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially like the budget for the job. She compares it to an agency, um, trying to bid for, you know, are we gonna take this project with this client? The client just want to tell you the budget, um, huge. You might be wasting your time, um, burning money, doing, trying to discover what the project is with and realize it\'s just too way too under budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, So, and there\'s a whole other, a lot of other things that go on along with trust and culture building. Um, what did you think of, of that piece? What</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I thought it was amazing. I wrote a piece about, uh, equal pay mm-hmm called put your money where your mouth is. Um, and she, yeah, hers was like way more in depth than mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, you know, you know, I don\'t say it was better than mine, so I thought it was amazing and she really. What I didn\'t think to do [00:28:00] that she did was actually going to the employers and saying, Hey, you know, we all know that a lot of people don\'t do it, but actually getting them to admit why they don\'t mm-hmm um, I thought was awesome because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, well, first of all, to me, that\'s a counter argument that we can start making, knowing why these people do that. Now, like some of the stuff, the reasons they gave like, well, oh, you know, a salary is sometimes the person dependent like a 40 year old and, uh, Porto it. They don\'t, um, that\'s single, you know, it\'s gonna be different than a 40 year old with a family in New York city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, okay, I don\'t care. Give me my money. Like, I, I hate, I hate that. Excuse the most, um, you know, I\'m biased. I don\'t have children, but I hate the excuse that, you know, because I\'m single, I don\'t need as much money as somebody with children. Right. Like, I don\'t care. Like, you don\'t know what I do with my money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t know what I need. You don\'t know what\'s going on in my life. So I hate that excuse. And I\'m so glad she, you know, went to bat on that. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> There\'s huge assumptions being made that, I mean, it\'s it\'s [00:29:00] yeah. It\'s plainly openly. Discriminatory. And I don\'t think that there you\'d even be legally allowed to ask the questions about family and marital status to make an informed discrimination about need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that would be a delicate conversation between friends about need. And, um, yeah, I, I, I agree with her that it was good to, to see what the thinking and, and different viewpoints are on that. I suspect a lot of people just really haven\'t thought about it. They haven\'t thought about it from the, from the job candidate perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t, I really don\'t think they\'re good reasons. And, and it\'s not, not some of the reason to be argued hard it\'s coming in the law and the, um, you can see the ethics of it, but just the business pragmatism of, if you care about having an inclusive and culture of happy employees, mm-hmm, . Why start with suspicion and just distrust, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can [00:30:00] afford not to, to, to operate without suspicion and distrust, what does that tell you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Tells me I don\'t need to work there. I need to go right. Run something up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> We\'ve we\'ve thought we\'ve actually talked about this before we did a, I think we did a whole episode, mostly devoted to your, your article and thoughts and experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, pay transparency and oh yeah. Employer, employee relationship and how it especially impacts women, people of color. Um, there was, there was a section of Peach\'s article that got into the stuff that\'s difficult for me and is good to think about that. I suppose I\'d paid more attention to in, in recent times, mm-hmm, just, if you have a, a background of, um, any number of experiences that, um, maybe particularly as a minority or someone with a disability or, or something like that, mm-hmm, , you\'re selling yourself short they\'re, they\'re just [00:31:00] simply, she\'s pretty direct about there\'s just NIH talks about her own experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people, you know, we just wanna do meaningful work, right? Yeah. So we\'re not awesome negotiators and. Um, maybe from rather unfortunate experiences, childhood later, other relationships, um, it\'s very hard for us not to start from the standpoint of, uh, well, of course I\'m not worth that much. Mm-hmm um, that, you know, if people who are, who are dealing with life stresses or emotional issues, um, if you bear down with all the advantages on them, when they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking employment. Um, you know, you may, you may hire someone at their worst mm-hmm and that experience will then color everything after I, I suspect, uh, but there\'s, there\'s whole, there\'s so many dimensions, uh, [00:32:00] to it all. Um, just being clear across the board with the whole team on, um, where everyone\'s. Um, yeah, we wouldn\'t have any, any gender gap, um, salary gap, if everyone knew what everyone was making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it, I think, um, and she, she brought this up like a lot of candidates believe like the employers don\'t want the employees to come together and, you know, demand. Adequate and fair pay. And I agree with that a hundred percent, like talking to people who have been like, I\'ll never tell anyone what I make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, why? I mean, cuz that\'s valid reason. It\'s not to tell people what you make, but their reasoning was more so like, well I think I make more of the company, so I\'m not going to say anything. And I\'m like, you\'re probably not making the most. Then you don\'t know there you\'re selling yourself short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I really agree with her point that, you know, It does seem like, it seems like a company trying to keep the workers divided when they do stuff like that. I, I definitely, I agree with [00:33:00] that. I that\'s what I believe if I see and hear stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Well, it\'s old as the Hills, but, um, yeah, it\'s very, I think it\'s very difficult depending on, on how far, how far that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm, , it\'s very difficult to. People to function well as a team and build a, a company culture without real trust mm-hmm . And once it starts to become a faked thing or, um, you know, people just doing, doing what they, you know, presenting themselves as how they. They think they need to be seen, um, not expressing how they actually feel about their, their job satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s, you know, that\'s a not gonna be, not gonna be good for any, anything, and in relationships. And it probably impacts performance in some way. It would be really cool. If someone got some data on that, like let\'s look at, let\'s look at [00:34:00] relatively similar companies that pay transparency, no pay transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there trends in the overall bottom line in results for the, for the company productivity, for the team, um, satisfaction ratings. I would, I would think happy employees make good results in good profits. Longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Same, same. I just . I, I like Colorado\'s, um, law on it. Colorado requires you to pay. You know, post the pay and, you know, a lot of companies have been skirt trying to skirt around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that just says more about the company than you. Anything else. And I\'m, I\'m definitely paying attention to that. I can start up multiple blood feuds if I need to. But, um, , I, um, I really like that, you know, you have to post post the pay. And I think a lot of companies also, they know that they\'re low balling people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They know that they\'re being cheap. They know they\'re not paying people with their [00:35:00] worth and that\'s what scares them. But I am optimistic about. I think that more and more states, probably not South Carolina, but more and more states will join in on this. And I think eventually it will be like a federal law in the United States, at least I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, how, how do you feel about the us and Canada in regards to this? That</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> would be, that would be great. And it\'s, it\'s interesting that it\'s happening now. I, I think in. Yeah, it\'s, it\'s an interesting historical shift because it it\'s something that\'s happening out outside of a, you know, organized labor movement, which is still stronger in the, in Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have trended down enormously over over the years. There are, there are, you know, little interesting movements, uh, big New York, uh, Web development agency. A friend of mine works at, um, formed union. Uh, you\'ve got people managing to do it at Amazon throughout, [00:36:00] throughout tech, but I, I don\'t think that that\'s the, that\'s not really the model anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and they didn\'t adapt well to, um, kind of postindustrial economics. And this is, this is more of a, um, seems more of a cultural thing. I feel. Kid, um, younger people, my kid\'s age, and, and to some extent, us Xers started to see things more. And look, you know, we, we can talk about this publicly and exert pressures, um, for this is the kind of culture we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how you should treat people. And it\'s, mm-hmm , it\'s okay to talk about them more openly and ethically. Cause I think we\'re on the other side of like civil. movement and stuff. It\'s hard. It\'s hard to, you were in a real radical, if you were saying things about transparency, maybe in the, in the thirties, or even trying to get something mm-hmm and, and all of, because there\'s [00:37:00] intensely segregated apart science society with different blocks of people who, you know, weren\'t really willing to go to bat for each other and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feel, it feels like it\'s just a different context and in some ways that\'s, that\'s really healthy and it can be less conflicted mm-hmm and it\'s, it\'s cool to see, I think, in, in the WordPress community, for sure. Um, it has maybe there\'s something to do with our aging. We\'re paying attention to accessibility mm-hmm and show up stability and, and you know, how we feel about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or work on life satisfaction. And I think younger mm-hmm people are tolerating less nonsense than we did. And times maybe tighter to, I don\'t know. Right. yeah. It\'s not that, I don\'t think it\'s that much different Canada. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, we\'re starting more blood feuds. I\'m sorry. I, uh, Tom Finley said that on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was like, I\'m sorry that happened to you, but I can\'t think of a better company to [00:38:00] start a blood feud with. And I was like, oh my God, I\'m gonna start saying that. Thank you. thank you, Tom. You\'re the best</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, we actually have quite a lot of employers like, like yours, who would do this voluntarily. I think mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling them to, um, Rob has definitely been a voice for that. And there are plenty of others who have been there all along. And it\'s definitely something we can choose to change just by talking about it, wanting and wanting to mm-hmm um, same as the accessibility thing, which is related. Um, I think the getting diversity equity and inclusion at the forefront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything organized. We do from word camps to how you think about employment, um, will, it has it\'s best, you know, it has to be done authentically. Um, I mean, great. If you\'re just following the rule and following other people, I guess that\'s what brings everyone along, but mm-hmm, [00:39:00] ideally you actually care about the culture you\'re building and working in and the people you\'re you\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> affect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree it would improve so many other areas outside of patron Spency and accessibility. So I definitely agree. It seems to be</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> happening. I mean, there\'s no, mm-hmm , um, you know, there, there was a bit, bit of static about travel scholarships or, you know, funding. Oh yeah. These are things like that, but I think that\'s that started to change and there\'s, there\'s definitely a, I\'ve only heard positive and receptive support for, um, doing what needs to be done to improve accessibility at conferences and the, and this whole transparency issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The there\'s a lot of positive signs about it. So, you know, I don\'t, I don\'t feel like it\'s not one of those issues where I feel like there\'s gonna be a bunch of drama or mm-hmm, , there\'s a mind field of things. And if you say the, the wrong thing, someone\'s gonna get really upset. Um, [00:40:00] it\'s just not, um, It\'s not at that, that level, which is, which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, uh, reasonable, mature, um, conversation to have at this point. Mm-hmm um, in, uh, WordPress history, I guess. So what, what do you think is what are, where do the next. Next moves. Do you, do you think for your you\'re always, you\'re kind of a change agent. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> chaos change agent. Um, but you\'re asking me, what are the next steps for, like, for what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> where for these kind of issues that, that you\'re, you\'re hoping to see change in, do you have, do you see specific things moving or where you\'re, where you and, um, Rob and the rest of your team are, you know, acting as influences or other people out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Who know what strings to pull to make things happen? I mean, [00:41:00] can\'t, did you listen, were you at Cammy K\'s uh, session at or camp? No, mm-hmm . That was definitely central to, to all of this. Um, yeah, I think there\'s will to will to change and certain. Voices driving</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it. Yeah. Um, our pretty much agreed model and way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that\'s, this was for me, even before I got into tech is to lead by example. And Rob does a really good, um, job of that, but that also helps us out too, as employees to push for these changes, because we can say, Hey look. We went and worked for an employee that was very transparent on pay and look how it\'s working out for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, we\'re not just yelling at people and telling them to do this, and it\'s something we have no knowledge on and we have no experience with. Um, so we\'re definitely doing that. Um, in terms of accessibility, I think that\'s going to take a community effort as well. Um, I think I talked about that, but one of my suggestions was, oh yeah, I did talk [00:42:00] about that earlier to just get like, we need like community transp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we to make sure, sure. It\'s accessible. We need, you know, and nothing. And I wrote this in article too. The volunteers and organizers for work camp were amazing and it was amazing. But we have to do better by everybody in the community by making sure things are more accessible. Um, absolutely tell wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it\'s a community effort. This can\'t fall on just one person. Yes. So just by leading the community, making sure we all know that we all are obligated. That\'s how I tell people we are. We\'re obligated. Even if it doesn\'t apply to you, that doesn\'t mean one day. It won\'t, there\'s this big thing where people think that they won\'t, some people think that they won\'t ever need accessible things and you don\'t know that anything can happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see my foot, I am. If the elevator breaks in my building, I can not leave so well, I can kind of waddle down the stairs, but you know, don\'t try to, oh, I won\'t, it will have to be an emergency. Um, [00:43:00] and you know, I was just walking around. At workout two, two weeks ago now so, you know, it happens, things happen, life happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re obligated to, in my opinion, do this for everyone. And even if you just know in your heart, nothing will ever happen to you. you just be obligated and helpful for your fellow community member?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah, the care. And there was tons of it to, to feel an experience there. And it, it was great that people mm-hmm , um, genuinely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for each other. And I think that\'s what it takes without, you know, without empathy for others. Um, and the ability to imagine their perspective and experience. Um, we\'re not very nice people, not very good to each other and that\'s, that\'s key to it. And you\'re right. Every time I saw those blue blue shirts, the volunteers, um, I, I said a lot of thanks and, and, you know, commiserated and, you know, eh, Don.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>don\'t [00:44:00] focus, you know, everything\'s not gonna be perfect. And mm-hmm we love you. anyway. that\'s your thank you for, for what you\'re doing. Mm-hmm yeah, I think AF afterwards they, they should all get like a gratitude care package or something free</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> massages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Cause it\'s, it\'s gotta</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> be spa day. Yeah. I will buy two spa days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For them. Okay.

They’re enhancing and building on the WordPress Core’s Theme Unit Test and <a href=\"https://www.abstractwp.com/announcing-wp-tests/\">Rich Tabor</a>’s Block Unit Test. The new tools they’ve created focus specifically on the block-based editor and all the possible configurations without building them all. <a href=\"https://www.abstractwp.com/announcing-wp-tests/\">On their blog</a>, Post Status member <strong>Victor Ramirez</strong> succinctly describes the frustration many of us face: “The blessing and the curse of the block-based editor is the near limitless layouts, patterns, & blocks. We realized it was near impossible to track all the possible configurations the client could create.” Indeed! WP Tests is a great new tool to add to your theme and block development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advanced Custom Fields Debuts Major Release 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first major release for ACF since it changed hands from <strong>Delicious Brains</strong> to <strong>WPEngine</strong>. I might even say it\'s the first major one since <strong>Elliot Condon</strong> sold ACF to Delicious Brains. Regardless, <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-6-0-released/\">this is a huge update</a> with a fresh new user interface, a switch to <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/whats-new-with-acf-blocks-in-acf-6/\">make ACF Blocks closer to the native block experience</a>, better accessibility, improved saving features like being able to toggle to “show in rest API,” and several other golden nuggets. This update is also “designed to be fully compatible with ACF 5.x and the vast majority of users will be able to upgrade without changing any code.” I\'m looking forward to playing with all these improvements in the weeks to come!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automate Your Sites with Better Social Sharing Images</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting good social sharing previews to work can be a hassle, that’s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpmark/status/1572197220463804417?s=21&t=JGIEhqYl_djD_HqO-mzDKg\"><strong>Mark Wilkinson</strong> and team</a> have created <strong><a href=\"https://simplesocialimages.com/\">Simple Social Images</a></strong> for WordPress. This plugin automates the creation of branded images for social media. So instead of a normal featured image or the first photo on the page, it can have a logo or text right on the image. The current version costs $49 but they’ve also submitted a free version to the <a href=\"http://WordPress.org\">WordPress.org</a> repository and are awaiting approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-18 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You Deserve a Terminal That Goes at Warp Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I stumbled onto <strong>Warp</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.warp.dev/\">a new terminal for Mac, Windows, and Linux</a> that uses “GPT-3 powered <a href=\"https://docs.warp.dev/features/ai-command-search#:~:text=Command%20Search%20-%20Warp%20Documentation&text=AI%20Command%20Search%20converts%20natural,See%20how%20it%20works%20here).\">AI search</a> will convert natural language into executable shell commands.” They had me at AI! They tout that “It’s like <strong>Github</strong> <strong>Copilot</strong> but for the terminal.” If that isn’t enough, Warp also takes a different approach to the command line user experience by making it act more like a text editor than your traditional terminal application. It has a nicer visual history with commands separated into “blocks” of content for easier viewing, and there\'s some more advanced theming than <strong>iTerm</strong> or <strong>Hyper</strong> have. They also have an upcoming feature to share a permalink of your session with your team. That’s gonna be so awesome it’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0\">sure to go plaid</a>!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Quick Links</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Otto</strong> answers <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/is-there-a-maximum-length-to-wordpress-user-passwords/\">Is there a maximum length to WordPress user passwords?</a> (<strong>Stack Exchange</strong>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/364624/is-there-a-maximum-length-to-user-passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">READ →</a></li><li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/copyright-selfie-monkeys-and-the-hand-of-god/\">Copyright, Selfie Monkeys, and the Hand of God</a> (From the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://deepdive.opensource.org/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast series on AI</a> and open source) <a href=\"https://deepdive.opensource.org/podcast/copyright-selfie-monkeys-the-hand-of-god/\">LISTEN →</a></li><li><strong>Brian Coords</strong> went on <strong>WP Builds</strong> to talk about <strong>WP-Notify</strong>: <a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/2022/09/01/294-how-might-we-fix-the-wordpress-notifications-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Revisiting the Notifications Problem</a>. <a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/2022/09/01/294-how-might-we-fix-the-wordpress-notifications-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LISTEN →</a></li></ul>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:15:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Daniel Schutzsmith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: PublishPress Acquires MetaSlider Plugin and MetaSlider Lightbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138097\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/publishpress-acquires-metaslider-plugin-and-metaslider-lightbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4123:\"<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/\">PublishPress</a>, a company that develops free and commercial publishing and permissions plugins for WordPress, has <a href=\"https://www.metaslider.com/metaslider-publishpress/\">acquired MetaSlider</a> from Extendify. The plugin is used on more than 700,000 sites to build sliders, slideshows, carousels, and galleries. The company&#8217;s mission is to help publishers succeed, so this is a curious acquisition as sliders seem to have fallen out of favor on the web over the past seven years, due to problems with SEO, performance, and poor engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A traditional slider isn&#8217;t a good fit for a news website for a couple of reasons,&#8221; PublishPress founder Steve Burge said. &#8220;First, publishers want a display that they can update easily. Second, they can be worried about the performance slowdown from a slider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We aim to tackle those problems head-on. To solve the first issue, we plan to expand dynamic content features of MetaSlider so you can easily pull in fresh content. And secondly, we&#8217;ll focus on the speed of MetaSlider, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about a slow site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge said PublishPress will use MetaSlider as a platform for building a suite of image tools. As part of the sale, the company has also acquired <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider-lightbox/\">MetaSlider Lightbox</a>, which has 10,000 active installs, and a photo gallery that&#8217;s in a beta version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There will be more [tools] to come,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;Most of my favorite publishers also have beautiful photography with their stories. From big WordPress publishers such as <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/\">Outside Magazine</a> to small start-ups such as <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/\">TheNarwhal</a>, the photos often add as much as the text. We hope to build tools to help publishers showcase their images.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge said the sale of MetaSlider started with a Twitter DM. He had never spoken with the Extendify team before but said the process was &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; because all the data was &#8220;clean and professionally organized.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The MetaSlider plugin is almost 10 years old, and in the last few years it was maintained by a couple of companies,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It was previously owned by the team behind UpdraftPlus and WP-Optimize. You can still see similarities in the orange color scheme between MetaSlider, UpdraftPlus, and WP-Optimize.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify took on the plugin as a side project but it was never a core product for their company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They were excited about our desire to invest in MetaSlider to ensure that it remains a great plugin for WordPress users,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;After some recent high-profile handovers went badly, we’ve seen sellers do careful due diligence on who they sell to.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge could not share any financial details of the acquisition but said the sale price was based strictly on revenue even though the MetaSlider plugin has nearly a million users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In most sales, the number of active installs is a bonus rather than a driving factor,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It’s not uncommon, particularly for older plugins, for 1% or less of active installs to convert to paying customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MetaSlider has a Pro version that PublishPress will continue sell and the plugins will remain as a standalone brand focused on images.

This release introduces a refreshed admin UI that ACF product manager Iain Poulson said users had been requesting since 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn’t want this to be a huge change that would disrupt a user’s workflow, but instead a light reskin that focuses on bringing user experience improvements to the Field Group editor,&#8221; Poulson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The team have done a great job with the new design, improving all the ACF plugin admin screens from the Field Group editor to the Tools page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reskinning delivers the following improvements: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reduces the vertical height of the field settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved experience adding new fields to a Field Group</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Added a sticky &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button to the header bar that is always visible without users having to scroll up to the top of the page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Added more width to &#8220;Fields&#8221; box to reduce cramping from nested subfields</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keyboard navigation for fields</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved focus states across the Field Group editor, toggle switches, radio buttons, and checkbox groups</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New opt-in setting for Repeater pagination</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.0 also includes <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/whats-new-with-acf-blocks-in-acf-6/\">ACF Blocks Version 2</a>, a feature included in ACF PRO. It allows developers to use a PHP-based framework for developing custom block types. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;ACF 6.0 contains a new block versioning system, allowing you to opt in to new versions which will change things like the markup and structure of ACF Blocks in both the backend and frontend, and may require updates to your theme to support,&#8221; Poulson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This next generation of ACF Blocks brings us much closer to the native block experience, while still giving you the PHP based templating language you know as a WordPress developer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF users were encouraged to see that the plugin is still moving forward after having changed hands twice in the past two years. Delicious Brains <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">acquired ACF</a> from its creator Elliot Condon in June 2021. By November of that year, Delicious Brains was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/acf-solicits-lifetime-license-holders-for-contributions-urging-them-to-purchase-annual-subscriptions\">soliciting the plugin&#8217;s Lifetime License holders for contributions</a> via email, urging them to purchase annual subscriptions. Seven months later, Delicious Brains sold off ACF and four other products to WP Engine, rattling customers who were concerned about the plugin&#8217;s lack of innovation and its stability in the hands of a large hosting company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson, who continued on with WP Engine to support Delicious Brains&#8217; products after they were acquired, said the next thing on the roadmap is adding the ability to register custom post types and taxonomies in the UI and improvements to how field types are selected.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 02:58:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.1 Beta 1 • Help Test • #WPTranslationDay • Video Courses #LearnWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122831\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-1-beta-1-help-test-wptranslationday-video-courses-learnwp/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14066:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-september-19-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (September 19, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The 6.1 Beta 1 release was briefly delayed a day but is now available.

Despite the flak that the Gutenberg plugin was catching before it was merged into core WordPress, I could see the potential. Yes, I could see the bugs, the inconsistent UI, and every other thing that was &#8220;wrong&#8221; about it around four or five years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was a vision for the future of theming that I latched onto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there was a bit of a rumor floating around that theme authors would eventually be able to allow users to edit any part of their theme with the block editor. It&#8217;d work similarly to sidebars. Developers would register &#8220;block areas,&#8221; and users could drop whatever content they wanted in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was <em>the</em> vision. It was the future of theming that I, along with several other developers, expected to see in the year or so following the block system&#8217;s launch in WordPress 5.0. It was a concept that sold us&#8212;<em>hook, line, and sinker</em>&#8212;on this newfangled editor all those years ago. It was such a simple but brilliant idea. We would finally consolidate some of the competing APIs, such as shortcodes and widgets, into a single standard. And themers would be dropping these block areas all over the place for highly-flexible themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, not everything played out according to the timeline in my head. However, WordPress 6.1 is finally introducing this feature in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42729\">block-based template parts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I had nearly forgotten about it over time. I&#8217;ve already been firmly on block-theme wagon for well over a year, and the thought of going back and building a classic theme just to use this feature didn&#8217;t excite me quite as much as it once would have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I still know that it is one of the most vital features for the theming community to land in WordPress. There are many reasons that developers have not made the full jump to block theming. It is not the ideal tool for every project yet, and that is an OK place to be. Whatever the reason, this is another tool for gradually adopting FSE features without going all in.  It allows developers to retain control over their top-level, PHP-based templates and decide which specific areas they want to expose to users as block <em>capable</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, block-based template parts may represent a stable medium for a while or even a new class of themes, those that are neither entirely classic nor block. It is the middle ground that the theming community has long needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it will even put the <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/the-imaginary-block-vs-classic-battle-in-wordpress/\">classic vs. block battle</a> to rest, at least for the theming community. <em>Do themers really have to choose between being &#8220;all in&#8221; or &#8220;all out&#8221;?</em> No. No, they do not. Maybe that happy middle ground has been a long time coming, but it has been a priority for the project. We&#8217;ve seen that with the inclusion of block-based menus and widgets, theme-support additions, <code>theme.json</code> support, and now template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Putting Theory into Practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began drafting this post before I ever tested the feature out within an actual classic theme. It sounded like everything I wanted years ago, at least in theory, but a question remained. <em>Did it hold up in practice?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to find out was to grab a classic theme and convert part of its front-end output to a block-based template part. Fortunately, Twenty Twenty-One was already using PHP-based template parts, so it offered a starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is not a full tutorial on using block-based template parts in classic themes. I encourage readers who want to dig deeper into the technical aspects to read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/09/12/testing-and-feedback-for-using-block-based-template-parts-in-classic-themes/\">call for testing</a> on the Make Themes blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most theme authors are aware of how template parts work in WordPress. Essentially, they are smaller templates (i.e., parts) that are included within larger ones. This can be anything from a header to footer or sidebar to comments form. There are no hard-and-fast rules, and the decisions about which parts exist come down to the theme authors themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use block-based template parts in classic themes, developers must add support for them via <code>functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">add_action( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'after_setup_theme\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>) </span>{\n    add_theme_support( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'block-template-parts\'</span> );\n} );</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-3\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JavaScript</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">javascript</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This creates a new &#8220;Template Parts&#8221; item under the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; admin menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Initial template parts screen when no parts are registered.\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, there will be nothing for users to do. However, once new parts are added, users will be able to edit them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my first true test of this feature, I decided to replace Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s header template part. Headers are often the most complex pieces of a website design, so it will not be the ideal starting point for every theme author making this transition. However, I was pretty successful in replacing Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s default header with a block-based version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After adding support for <code>block-template-parts</code>, into the theme setup function in <code>functions.php</code>, I created a new <code>parts/header.html</code> file and proceeded to recreate the basic branding and navigation menu sections directly in the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Recreating Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s header as a block template part.\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the look I wanted (or, at least, close enough), I copied the block code from the editor into <code>parts/header.html</code> and deleted my customizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in the theme&#8217;s <code>header.php</code> file, I replaced the following line of code with my own:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> get_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'template-parts/header/site-header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-4\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>The new code was a call to the block-based template part, which would load the <code>parts/header.html</code> file (or the user-customized version):</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> block_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-5\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>I would love to exclaim, &#8220;<em>Voila</em>!&#8221; and call it a day. I would love to say that this was a simple one-and-done action, but developers know it is never as straightforward as that. Most classic themes were not built to handle block output outside of the content area. Twenty Twenty-One is no different. I had to make some other changes to actually make this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing was removing a max-width set by the Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s <code>assets/css/style-editor.css</code> file that was keeping full-width blocks from stretching across the editor. So, I cut this bit of code from the file:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">max-width</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">var</span>(--responsive--aligndefault-width);\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-6\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">CSS</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">css</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>I also needed to add layout support via <code>theme.json</code>. Because the theme didn&#8217;t include this file, I created it and kept the settings as simple as possible using Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s existing custom CSS properties:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        }\n    }\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-7\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>These were just quick fixes to ensure that the system worked. Each theme will be a bit different and each theme author will have some obstacles to overcome in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a better user experience, I also defined my header template part via <code>theme.json</code>. This allowed me to create a internationalized version of its user-facing title. So, the final version of my JSON file became:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        }\n    },\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"templateParts\"</span>: [\n        {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"title\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"area\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>\n        }\n    ]\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-8\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This last bit is not a requirement, but it does create a better all-around experience. Theme authors shouldn&#8217;t skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how well block-based template parts will truly work without also opting into some <code>theme.json</code> support. At minimum, layout settings are likely recommended. This is why it is vital that theme authors start testing before WordPress 6.1 launches. These little tips and tricks must become a part of our collective knowledge so that we can share and help one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Was the Feature All That I Thought It Would Be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a couple of natural hiccups from having to change some style-related bits in the theme, it was a success. For good measure, I tested a few other template parts and felt good with the results. The process would have been much easier with one of my own themes, something I was intimately familiar with. However, I chose Twenty Twenty-One because it is more accessible to the WordPress extender community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many ways that themers can utilize this once WordPress 6.1 lands (or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-1-now-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you can start now using Beta 1</a>). For example, an easy win is making an editable &#8220;404 page content&#8221; part. This is one of those areas that has long required developers to either build custom solutions for or just leave it to users to directly edit PHP files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can replace sidebars, headers, and footers. They can allow end-users to edit archive page queries. Or, go even more ambitious and create block-based template parts for everything but the outer structure of the front end. There are no right or wrong answers. Developers have the flexibility to choose the path that&#8217;s best for them and their users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:09:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: New Features to Test in Gutenberg 14.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=123001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/new-features-to-test-in-gutenberg-14-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:897:\"<p>A reminder from <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> about the importance of your help <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/gutenberg-testing/\">testing Gutenberg</a> 14.1 in advance of the WordPress 6.1 release:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you have the current Gutenberg (plugin) release installed, you can use block template parts without adopting everything that comes with block templates.

Hello, Nick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] Nick Ahmann: Hi, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] Nathan Wrigley: Very nice to have you. We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena in Porto. Have you ever been to a WordCamp before? Is this your first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] Nick Ahmann: No, it&#8217;s my first ever WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] Nathan Wrigley: So what brings you? What is it exactly that you&#8217;ve decided?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. So for one it&#8217;s the networking part. We&#8217;re surely gonna talk about later, we, um, working on a couple of WordPress products and TasteWP, and I wanna spread the word for it. I also just wanna immerse myself in the WordPress spirit and energy. And what&#8217;s a better way than going to a WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. If you&#8217;ve not been to an event like this before, have you been in the WordPress space for any length of time or is this fresh to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s not entirely fresh. So we&#8217;ve been developing plugins for about six, seven years now. Not me personally, I don&#8217;t have a clue about coding. I&#8217;ve been in the space that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] Nathan Wrigley: What is it that you&#8217;re expecting to do? I know you said that there was networking, but do you anticipate going into some of the talks? Is there any of that that interests you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, for sure. I&#8217;m gonna listen to some of the talks. I&#8217;ve noted down one or two. But it&#8217;s just, you know, meeting like random people in the hallway and just getting to know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] Nathan Wrigley: The hallway track is totally a thing. It&#8217;s a thing which I think probably a significant proportion of the people who come to these events actually never go into the presentations because they just enjoy the networking aspect and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna talk today about a service that you offer. It integrates very well with WordPress. It is WordPress. It enables you to get WordPress in a heartbeat. It&#8217;s called TasteWP. What is it? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The point is, basically TasteWP, developed from scratch your own itch situation for us. Working on a couple of plugins and we needed an easy way to test them, different PHP versions and, and WordPress version combinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we never found a tool that really suits us. So we thought, okay, why not create such a tool? And then we thought, okay, uh, instead of just using it internally, why don&#8217;t we just make it a bit nicer and bit more self explanatory, as you would with a tool you only use internally, so that, uh, we can offer it to the public. So TasteWP is a site where you just go, click once and then it spins up a WordPress site where you can play around and test themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: So I confess that I&#8217;ve had a go and it&#8217;s very quick. I don&#8217;t know if that was part of the initial scoping document, to make it almost instantaneous, but when you go to the webpage and you click the button, there&#8217;s more to it than that, we&#8217;ll get to that, but if you just click the button, I&#8217;m pretty convinced you&#8217;re under five seconds before the site is live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] Nick Ahmann: Right. Just over three seconds is now the average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: Which is pretty incredible given what&#8217;s going on. You know, you&#8217;re spinning up some sort of server in the background and downloading plug-ins and themes. And again, we&#8217;ll get to that and it&#8217;s configurable, but it&#8217;s basically there in the time it takes you to pick up your coffee cup, have a sip, and then return it to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] Nick Ahmann: And let me just mention, I wish I could take credit for it, but it&#8217;s entirely the developers who did this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] Nathan Wrigley: The, principle though, when we got into talking about coming on the podcast, you talked about it from the community angle. You mentioned that it would be a really nice tool for community to get their hands on. Talk to us about that. Tell us how do you sort of pitch it as a community tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] Nick Ahmann: Right. I think it&#8217;s our contribution to the community in the sense that I think everybody who works with WordPress, uh, no matter what the role of function is that they need such a tool. You can talk about the developers who need a site to test their themes and plugins like that was the initial idea, why we needed it. But then beginners who just start out with WordPress, they need an easy way to spin up a site and play around. Also again for developers to demo their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you can do is, if you, for example, if you&#8217;re in the, um, plug-in directory on WordPress and you on a plugin page, like, wordpress.org/plugins/pluginslug. And in that URL, if you just replace WordPress with TasteWP and click enter, then it spins up a site with that plugin already installed. And that&#8217;s useful, I think for almost everybody, especially also for those who want to try out plugins before using them on the real site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] Nathan Wrigley: So the principle is, it felt like the best fit for me, at least anyway, was I want to try out this plugin, X plugin over there that I&#8217;ve never used before, and I could create a domain and do all of that and do hosting, or I could set up a local install or something like that, which will work fine, but I want something probably a bit more disposable. I know that I&#8217;m just gonna try it for a few hours perhaps, and then I want that site to go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what it does because, in the initial offering that you&#8217;ve got, maybe there&#8217;s kinda like a premium upsell that you offer as well, but you are able to use that site for, I believe it&#8217;s 48 hours. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s right. So if you&#8217;re not logged in TasteWP, it&#8217;s good for two days and then expires. And, uh, if you sign up on TasteWP, which is free, then it lasts for seven days and then you can also manage your sites. So you can set up several ones. You can delete an old site set up a new site and so on. And at the moment it&#8217;s all free. And we&#8217;re working on a premium option when basically it won&#8217;t expire then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So in the future there&#8217;ll be an option to pay and you&#8217;ll be able to keep your site up. Okay. So at the point where you create the site, there&#8217;s multiple options. You could just click the button and you go. And like I said, 2, 3, 4 seconds later, it&#8217;s ready to go, but there&#8217;s a little bit more to it than that. Tell us about the options that are available. What can you configure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:43] Nick Ahmann: So there&#8217;s the quick setup option, by the way, you can always trigger it again without being logged in, which makes it very usable. But, if you click on the advanced setup option, then you can determine, okay, which WordPress version do you wanna use the plugin or whatever you&#8217;re testing on. Especially now that WordPress six came out. That was a function, which was used quite a lot because plugin developers want to see, how does the plugin work on WordPress six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same with PHP version. You can set that. You can already select to pre-install certain plugins, themes, that&#8217;s possible too. If you sign up, then you can also create templates, where you can say, okay, this URL should spin up an instance with these plugins and these themes already installed, because sometimes you have plugins which rely on other plugins to be installed as well. So it&#8217;s not just a single plugin, which is installed in, but also others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:36] Nathan Wrigley: So essentially the idea here is speed. You&#8217;ve got the option to just, you get to the site, you don&#8217;t need to be logged in if you&#8217;re willing to go for a two day site. You press a button, a couple of seconds later you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things which come along for the ride. In WordPress, we&#8217;re a bit averse to advertising in the admin UI. I know that you have a fairly large, dismissable, ad right at the beginning. It&#8217;s not really an ad. It&#8217;s more sort of, here&#8217;s how it works, because you&#8217;ve already got them to your website. So, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] Nick Ahmann: Actually that&#8217;s a good point. We made that part much leaner. So actually there was this like almost full page introduction, uh, which is now only, if you spin it up in certain ways, we&#8217;re gonna expand it to all the ways you can spin up. It&#8217;s just a box in the top right which says this is a demo site expiring in, um, so and so many hours. But if you talk about advertising to be absolutely honest here, part of the incentive for us to do this was also to promote our own plugins because they are pre-installed as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not entirely, you know, off topic. There&#8217;s a backup and migration plugin, which many TasteWP users need because whatever they created on TasteWP, they want to take it somewhere else. So they need this migration plug. So it&#8217;s not completely off topic, but that&#8217;s also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:48] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s go into that, because I think that is actually right on topic. So you justifiably, I think in my opinion, if you&#8217;ve offered this service for free, people don&#8217;t have to use it. They can do all the other things that I said earlier about spinning up sites, they can do it that way. Or they can opt for you. What are the things that do come pre-installed? Presumably it&#8217;s the suite of things that you and the company that you are working for offer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s three plugins now. It&#8217;s a redirect plug. The backup plugin I mentioned, and the plugin for, uh, showing popups on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: And they all come pre-installed? Yeah. And I&#8217;m guessing though, it&#8217;s WordPress, I&#8217;m guessing that you could deactivate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes, absolutely. You can, actually, there&#8217;s a plugin, which if you run it, it resets. I think it&#8217;s called reset WordPress, I&#8217;m not sure what plugin is. And quite a few people use that because they don&#8217;t want to see our plugins. But most, you know, still see our plugins and that&#8217;s part of the reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s talk about the different ways that you can get certain things to be activated. Obviously, if you choose to go in, you can just go to the ad plugin page and add one plugin at a time. But there&#8217;s this nifty thing which you alluded to earlier, which, as soon as I figured out what was going on, because I didn&#8217;t, when I first came across your site. Soon as I figured that out, I thought, okay, that&#8217;s the bit, that&#8217;s where the coin dropped for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the utility came in. You can go to TasteWP.com farward slash, and then how do we do the URL from there? Basically, if you add to the URL, something that&#8217;s in the repository, be that a theme or a plugin. So long as you get the plugin slug exactly right, it will become installed. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit that I missed out in the URL there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes. So the easiest way is if you just go to the plugin in the, uh, WordPress directory, and then replace the WordPress in the URL with TasteWP. So that&#8217;s the quickest, actually that&#8217;s not the quickest way. We also offer a bookmarklet tool, which is a button you can drop to your bookmarklet bar in your browser. And then when you are on a plugin page in the directory, you just have to click it and then already it spins up instance with that plugin installed. And we are also working at the moment on a Chrome extension, which basically does the same thing, but maybe some little more features here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:57] Nathan Wrigley: So can you concatenate, so can you add, one plugin, two two plugins, three plugins and two themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] Nick Ahmann: There&#8217;s more sophisticated ways you can install several plugins and themes, uh, at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:08] Nathan Wrigley: And so the bookmark would then store the information about that because you have essentially kept the URL with all of the bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve added to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] Nick Ahmann: Right so what happens technically? This is one of the few instances where I understand what happens technically, because as mentioned, I&#8217;m not a developer. If you click on the bookmarklet tool, when on the plugin page in the directory, something called HTTP referral, which passes on the URL you&#8217;re currently on to TasteWP. So TasteWP knows from which side you&#8217;re coming from. So we know which plugin you have in mind to have pre-installed. And that&#8217;s what we, what we&#8217;re doing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:41] Nathan Wrigley: Has this been a popular tool? I mean, I dunno how how long it&#8217;s been out. I certainly came across it for the first time ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:46] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a good question, how long? I think about a year now. And yes, the usage is increasing strongly. Uh, we getting fantastic feedback from developers, but also non developers. Especially as it&#8217;s free and it can be used without logging that that&#8217;s what people like a lot. Of course, that&#8217;s also prone to risks because you know, people can do dodgy things on these free sites. They can use it for phishing attempts and all of that, because there are no checks, basically, if somebody spins up a site, if it&#8217;s not dodgy. So we have to stay one step ahead in terms of quickly identifying the sites, which could cause trouble. I don&#8217;t know what the percentage is. Most are nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:30] Nathan Wrigley: And what have they been using it for then? Have you got some useful metrics? No, sorry, what are the genuine people using it for? You know, they&#8217;ve got a two day site. Why are they coming to you and trying it it out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] Nick Ahmann: Okay. So for one it&#8217;s developers who want to try out the plugins. Other big segments are beginners, and also that the teachers. The teachers, WordPress teachers love TasteWP to, for example, give their students some exercises they have to do. So spin up a site in TasteWP and install this plugin and do this, create this theme or whatever it is. So teachers also a big segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:06] Nathan Wrigley: it&#8217;s really curious. I mean, if you delve deeper into it, do you have any sort of data about what people want you to do with it in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:14] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s a good question. I mean, WordPress can be used in so many different ways? I mean, what we focus on now at the moment is a tool for developers. And also there has another reason too. The developers can be our multipliers, because if we convince the developers to use our URL as a demo URL they use it for demoing their products. Then that means that way more users get to know about TasteWP and therefore we have more users. That&#8217;s the focus just to grow and get the word out about TasteWP. Then we can eventually at the end of the, the game we can monetize by offering the pay plans, which we don&#8217;t offer yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way everything you see at the moment, it will stay free forever. So we will need to justify the, the paid part with additional features we gonna add to the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s curious, and it really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a plug-in developer and I&#8217;ve got a plugin over on the repo. Am I right in saying this? Is what you&#8217;re saying that I could simply copy and paste the TasteWP URL, put it over on my site and anybody that wants to try out my plugin instantly has access to that, obviously with the caveats that we&#8217;ve mentioned and the plugins that you bring to, to the site as well. But you would be able to use that plugin right off the bat, in couple of seconds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nick Ahmann: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. That makes more sense. Okay. I want to delve deeper into the sort of marketing angle here. Whose idea was it to offer the free service as the gateway if you like to the paid service? Because it feels to me there&#8217;s a lot of development work that went into this and it could have been an absolute flop, and it could have been never used by anybody, never discovered. And then it would&#8217;ve just been a complete waste of time, resources and of that. So who pushed this forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] Nick Ahmann: We always knew we needed the tool at least ourselves, which first of all means that even if nobody was interested in it, it was, you know, still worthwhile. The point is if you need it very strongly, there must be other people out there who needed it as well. So that gave us a bit of confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the free part is basically, our general philosophy in the freemium model. We offer some other tools and services as well. And for all of them the first challenge is to get users and to grow. And the freemium model is great. It&#8217;s great for us because we get the eyeballs, and it&#8217;s great for the users because they can use a lot of features for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it will probably, once we introduce the paid versions, it will still be the typical 98% of people not paying, just free riding, and it&#8217;s the 2% which monetize the whole thing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:48] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have any data on, so at the minute, the paid version doesn&#8217;t exist, so that&#8217;s kind of off the table, but maybe in the future that&#8217;ll be a thing. So at the minute, the upsell is okay. here&#8217;s a free site. You can have it for a couple of days or seven days, depending on you logged in on it. But you mentioned all of the things that you throw in your backup plug in and so on and so forth. How has that conversion gone? Has it been successful? One site is better than no sites, but has it been effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] Nick Ahmann: We&#8217;d love to know that, but it&#8217;s so hard to track. We don&#8217;t know because I mean, they then see the plugin on our site, but well, we know it&#8217;s installed there. But the question is do they then find joy in it and also install it on their real actual sites? We have no way to track this. So this is just believing in building our brand and getting some recognition this way. But we don&#8217;t know how effective that actually is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:37] Nathan Wrigley: One of the things about the WordPress community is that they are, they&#8217;re ingenious. My experience is they often like to do things for themselves. You know, they like figure things out, solve puzzles, but there&#8217;s also a, a significant part who just like convenience and so on. So I&#8217;m guessing you are aiming it more those people who just like to have something quick and simple and easy. Is that your target market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Nick Ahmann: Yes. I mean, naturally because these are advantages that people who have these inclinations tend to use TasteWP. I mentioned the developers earlier. Some developers say, no, they want to have the local environment, which also has of course advantages. It doesn&#8217;t expire. There&#8217;s no space limitation and so on. It comes down also to personal taste very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So let&#8217;s go into the paid model, which at the moment doesn&#8217;t exist. So caveat emptor. It might not in any way, shape or form look like what you&#8217;re about to describe, but let&#8217;s press on regardless. If we go for the premium, the upsell, whatever that thing is, you mentioned it will never go away. Are there other things which you are toying with as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] Nick Ahmann: Yes. The main one is the space one as well, because the free sites are limited to, I think, one gigabyte, which is not enough for some use cases. But most it is. I mean, one gigabyte is already quite some space. For some, it&#8217;s not enough. So that will be the main premium feature as well. What we don&#8217;t know yet, if we want to go down that route is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, naturally people want then to host with their own domain. That would mean we would just turn into a hoster and I&#8217;m not sure if we really want to do that. We&#8217;re playing with ideas to team up with a hosting, um, where we then pass on these users who need permanent hosting, not just for testing with their own domain and everything that comes with it, the backups also and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are not sure about that yet, but, for sure, even if it&#8217;s just for the testing there quite a few people out there who just want sites which don&#8217;t expire for testing alone. By the way, talking about not expiring, we offer an affiliate program. If you spin up a site, you will see that we offer you, if you invite your friends, and three of them sign up on TasteWP, you get a non expiring site. So that&#8217;s free hosting forever. Because you also mentioned marketing earlier, that&#8217;s another way we try to accelerate the marketing part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:50] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so if I&#8217;ve signed up for the, the paid plan, and I can use it forever. Do I just recycle that one site? In other words, do I get one site which I can just have forever, but I can just, as you said, reset at the beginning? How do I go through that process of expunging it, wiping it clean? Because presumably I&#8217;ve got a URL which is custom to me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:10] Nick Ahmann: Yes. At the moment what&#8217;s already possible, you can define the sub domain. So Nathan dot TasteWP, unless it&#8217;s taken already of course. And then once you are, you&#8217;re logged into TasteWP, there&#8217;s a dashboard where you can manage your sites and you can just delete one site, in order to spin up another site. Which then, once we have the paid plans you can use for that. So it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re not stuck with a one site you created once, but you can just delete it. And then you have the right to set up a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] Nathan Wrigley: Any chance of siloing those. So putting a site away and saying, actually, I&#8217;ll come back to that next week, but this week I need to test this plugin out? So I don&#8217;t wanna remove that one, I just park it for a few days. Can you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nick Ahmann: With the pay plans, yes. The paid plans depend on the number of sites you want. So it&#8217;s per site and there will be discount, discounts for if, you know, go for three sites at once. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gonna work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:06] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna move away from TasteWP now, and just talk about, well, we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. Just gonna talk about what you&#8217;ve gained so far and what you think of it. You mentioned that you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp Europe before. I&#8217;ve been to a WordCamp Europe before. But this is quite significantly different to the ones that I&#8217;ve been to. In that this, this is really quite an impressive event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] Nick Ahmann: I don&#8217;t have any comparison. I didn&#8217;t know really what to expect. So when you say, uh, it&#8217;s different to the other ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] Nathan Wrigley: Bigger. Very professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] Nick Ahmann: I noticed that at the queue, when I wanted to get my food, that it&#8217;s huge. It was, it took quite a while. I knew that. How many at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:43] Nathan Wrigley: The last count I got was 2,700.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nick Ahmann: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nathan Wrigley: But I don&#8217;t know if that went up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] Nick Ahmann: Yeah. I mean, I knew it&#8217;s gonna be a lot, but it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] Nathan Wrigley: But for a free piece of software, it&#8217;s kind of extraordinary don&#8217;t you think? You know, something which you can download absolutely gratis, completely for free. If you just walk down the corridor, there&#8217;s bespoke signage for every single thing. Every window has got a WordCamp logo on it. Can you imagine the amount of effort by people who are not paid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:14] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s actually, now that you mentioned, I did think, um, when I saw just the, when new map and also just the emails you get ahead of the event, that, okay, this is done quite professionally. But it shows, you know, people may not get paid for it, but it shows the passion really drives quality, right, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] Nathan Wrigley: The passion is amazing, but this room that we&#8217;re in is pretty spartan, but the fact that somebody&#8217;s made an effort to make that and put that there. So behind Nick is a great big WordCamp Europe banner. So that in a minute, when the photographers come in, that&#8217;s behind you. There&#8217;s a lot of attention to detail, given that these people are doing it from remote destinations all over the world. And I think it&#8217;s incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] Nathan Wrigley: Anything we missed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Nick Ahmann: TasteWP is only part of other products. I mentioned the plugins, but there are a couple of others. So if you go to inisev.com, so in is ev is the first two letters of information is everything inisev.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re just gonna see our whole range of products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:13] Nathan Wrigley: Just outline them, just say what they are again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:15] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The main other products are follow it, which is a news platform, which also web admins can use to put a subscription form on their site so people can subscribe and then automatically get updated whenever a new post is published. My popups is a service where you can put the so much loved popups and banners. They don&#8217;t have to be annoying if you do it the right way, at the right time. Not right directly in your face, doesn&#8217;t have to be annoying. And also this, cookie notices are covered there as well. So, which are legal requirement, at least in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and we have also a tracking app, which basically allows you to track anything you want in your life. Where manual data entry is not much of a hassle, so you can track things and then analyze correlations. So see if you work out that day, if that has an impact on your sleep and find things out about yourself. So nothing related to WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] Nathan Wrigley: And the one that is the one that probably I would be most drawn to is your back up and restore plugin? What&#8217;s that one called?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:14] Nick Ahmann: Backup migration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:15] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. For reasons that I can&#8217;t quite explain every single time I find a backup and restore plugin, I&#8217;m totally drawn to trying it out, but I haven&#8217;t tried yours out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:24] Nick Ahmann: You have to, if you appreciate speed, apparently which you do, then please try it out because it is very fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:29] Nathan Wrigley: Well, Nick, thank you for joining me on the podcast. Really appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: WooCommerce is Important for African Businesses and Beyond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72902\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-is-important-for-african-businesses-and-beyond/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:455:\"<p>The fact that WooCommerce open-sourced this to run on top of WordPress, this has helped a lot of businesses to push forward.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-is-important-for-african-businesses-and-beyond/\">devlife_snippet: WooCommerce is Important for African Businesses and Beyond</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 09:31:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Post Status: What’s in a Name?

It&#8217;s a far cry from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">500 block themes</a> WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy set as a goal for 2022, but the number is steadily climbing as theme authors find their footing and discover how quickly block themes can be created.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Gardner is throwing his hat into the ring again with his latest release. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">Design Mode</a> is a new block theme created for freelancers and agencies to showcase their services and work. After its release, several of Gardener&#8217;s contemporaries, fellow theme designers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/1571867105728815106\">remarked</a> on how refreshing it is to see a block theme with &#8220;real world use cases,&#8221; as so many seem to be geared at bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode features <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit\">Outfit</a>, a geometric sans serif Google font, designed by Rodrigo Fuenzalida, a Venezuelan type designer based in Santiago de Chile. It is used for both headings and paragraph text throughout the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bg.design/design-mode/\">demo</a> gives the best idea of what the theme looks like with a curated set of images, titles, captions, menus, and buttons all filled with content. Once installed and activated on a new site, the theme looks very similar to the demo but has a placeholder image instead of the photos used in the demo. This is because the photos  did not have the right licensing for distribution on WordPress.org, but the way it ships has the advantage of giving users a visual blank slate for those featured sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode includes 10 different patterns, which are essentially all aspects of the design deconstructed into parts. There are multiple patterns for sections with cover, heading, text, and button, a query grid with three columns, a section with text and separators, a footer, and a header with site title and navigation perfectly spaced. The theme also conveniently includes a whole page pattern that will instantly reproduce the homepage in the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is an opinionated theme. Users can adjust colors for background, text, and links, and adjust various templates via full-site editing, but it does not come with additional style variations. Personal blogs may benefit from a kaleidoscope of style variations but a well-designed portfolio theme does not usually lend itself well to wide variations in style. In this case fewer options is a good thing that should preserve the simple palette the theme packages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very fast theme by itself. Gardner reports that Design Mode scores 99 and 100 on Google page speed for mobile/desktop. Depending on what plugins and optimizations a user has active, this theme could be a good choice for performance-conscious WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is Gardner&#8217;s third block theme in the directory. It bears some similarities to his black and white minimalist <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/avant-garde/\">Avant-Garde</a> theme but has more of a friendly showcase vibe that is suitable for personal portfolios, agencies, and any kind of service business that would benefit from an elegant, structured design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> or inside WordPress via the admin themes browser.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 22:06:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WebP by Default Pulled from Upcoming WordPress 6.1 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-pulled-from-upcoming-wordpress-6-1-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3791:\"<p>Last month, the plan for WordPress to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-on-hold-for-6-1-after-new-objections-from-wordpress-lead-developers\">put on hold for the upcoming 6.1 release</a> after objections from lead developers.

Yesterday, the feature was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:203\">reverted</a> in response to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/webp-in-core-for-6-1/\">post</a> about removing it from core in favor of development as a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-renews-push-for-canonical-plugins\">canonical plugin</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I’ve been reading through all the conversation and issues here. I am interested in supporting new formats and improving performance, but I think this change being pushed by default to users when they upgrade to 6.1 is a lot for right now, including with some of the clunky interactions OSes still have around webp (and HEIC!) files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m happy for support for working for webp and HEIC files to stay in&nbsp;core, as we should be liberal in what we accept and work with, but not with the change to convert everything to webp when JPEGs are uploaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During today&#8217;s Performance Team meeting, contributors briefly discussed the revert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are still trying to figure out what a canonical plugin is exactly, and if that would work for WebP by default,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein said. &#8220;We still have a couple of fixes to land for 6.1 around image quality when WebPs are output (which is still an option you just need a plugin for now).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the previous Performance team meeting Silverstein said Mullenweg&#8217;s post about the feature not shopping was a surprise to the team and that they were working with release leads to better understand concerns in hopes of finding a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to acknowledge this is a blow for everyone who worked on the feature (myself included) and at the same time I&#8217;d like to encourage us to focus on how we can move forward given the current position,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Are there concerns we can address? Does a canonical plugin make sense?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in that discussion expressed concerns about getting users to adopt WebP by default if it is moved to its own plugin. It would require strategic rebranding to indicate that it delivers faster images, as most users won&#8217;t be familiar with the WebP format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think if it remains a &#8216;feature project,&#8217; it makes sense to remain in the Performance Lab plugin &#8211; we don&#8217;t know if moving it out of it would get us more testers (especially since the Performance Lab plugin has 10k+ installs which is a lot for a feature plugin),&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If the path of a &#8216;canonical plugin&#8217; should be pursued, then of course we would need to take it out, but then the nature of the project would also change.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors will decide the next steps for the feature in future discussions. For now, users who were looking forward to WebP uploads by default can still get this feature using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin, maintained by WordPress&#8217; Performance Team. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:29:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:443:\"<p>Kevin Ohashi from Review Signal and Ryan MacDonald from Liquid Web discuss the value of benchmarking and testing for hosting services. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\">A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 10:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: New Block Diffusion Plugin Creates AI-Generated Images from Text Prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137969\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-diffusion-plugin-creates-ai-generated-images-from-text-prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3269:\"<p>AI image generation has quickly become more accessible over the past few months and is making its way into different industries that require asset creation. Although it&#8217;s still somewhat limited, AI image generators can create breathtaking photorealistic images from complex prompts. AI-assisted artists have even begun <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artists-begin-selling-ai-generated-artwork-on-stock-photography-websites/\">selling their works</a> on stock photography sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DALL-E 2 was the first to make a big splash on social media. Its closed platform and invite-only beta has kept many potential creators on the sidelines, but open source alternatives like Stable Diffusion are taking off. The machine learning, text-to-image model is improving thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/\">growing ecosystem</a> of contributors and extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinbatdorf\">Kevin Batdorf</a>, an Application Developer at <a href=\"https://extendify.com/\">Extendify</a>, has created a free plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stable-diffusion/\">Block Diffusion</a> that uses Stable Diffusion to generate images inside the block editor based on text prompts. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Block Diffusion uses the public Replicate API to generate images in the cloud. This requires users have an account at replicate.com. It will generate some images for free but thereafter will be $0.01 USD per image using Replicate&#8217;s <a href=\"https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion\">Stable Diffusion model</a>. Images generate in six seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model was trained on <a href=\"https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/\">LAION-5B</a>, an open AI training dataset containing over five billion image-text pairs. It has some limitations in that it cannot achieve perfect photorealism or render legible text. It also may have difficulty rendering faces and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many WordPress content use cases, the Stable Diffusion model should be adequate for illustrating posts and creating unique featured images. Batdorf plans to add the following features in future releases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use an existing image as starting point</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add an image mask to only generate specific areas</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help with prompt ideas and inspiration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run multiple image predictions at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have more control over the image generation steps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>View your prediction history</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Model selection from collections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Diffusion plugin is a personal side project for Batdorf and he doesn&#8217;t plan to turn it into a commercial plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are no plans to lock any features behind a pro or premium plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All features will be added to this version on wordpress.org. Over time I plan to add all features supported by Replicate, as well as additional features for the WordPress community specifically.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Batdorf said users who find the plugin useful can support its continued development by <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/KevinBatdorf\">sponsoring the project on GitHub</a> through monthly or one-time contributions .</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 04:23:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: SiteGround Launches Managed EDD Hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137952\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/siteground-launches-managed-edd-hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1829:\"<p>SiteGround launched a new <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/edd-hosting\">managed Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) hosting product </a>today, the first of its kind among WordPress hosts.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Today, we are going to talk about Gutenberg 14.1, WordPress 6.1, and a lot of good design tools. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time contributor to the WordPress open-source project. And, today, I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me, as co-host, Channing Ritter, from the WordPress design team and design director at Automattic. Good afternoon, Channing. Thank you for joining me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We have been trying to do this together for so many months. So happy it&#8217;s worked out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. So what have you been working on at Automattic right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I have been working a lot on the 2023 default theme that&#8217;s coming up soon with the 6.1 release. It&#8217;ll be released alongside 6.1 in November. So it&#8217;s been a really, really interesting process. It&#8217;s different than the way we&#8217;ve previously done the default theme, in the sense that it&#8217;s been very collaborative with folks all across the community helping design the theme and designing different style variations that will get bundled with the theme. So it&#8217;s been a really interesting process. We&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So how many submissions did you get?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: We got 38 total. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow. Yeah. For a first time, that&#8217;s really cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Very cool. And they&#8217;re amazing submissions as well. If you go through the repository and just glance through what people submitted, they&#8217;re so creative. They&#8217;re so unique, and everything&#8217;s really pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in the editor currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. We will show in the&#8230; We&#8217;ll share, in the show notes, the link to the repositories so, dear listeners, you can go and kind of browse around, get your own creativity going. And, also, is there a process for, or thought about a process for, the ones that don&#8217;t make it into the default theme because there were only 10 that make it? What happens with the others? Is there a way to download them, upload them, or something like that? Or what would be a good process to also use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There should be. We haven&#8217;t quite figured out what it will be yet, but it sounds like it might be a child theme or some way of showcasing all these amazing submissions. Because, like you said, there&#8217;s so many cool ones. And we really are only moving forward with 10 that will get bundled with the theme. But I think folks would definitely love to be able to play with all of the submissions because there&#8217;s some great stuff there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I know that Justin Tadlock plans to do a child scene with that, with his variation, and maybe bundles others as well. So we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: His submission rough draft was really great. I really enjoyed his submission especially.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Well, thank you for going through this with me. So the first announcement that we have is, of course, yesterday&#8230; No, September 13th, the release team was on a recorded public Zoom call to discuss what features will make it into WordPress 6.1. And, of course, the recording is available now on WordPress make blog. I will share it in the show notes. But, also, the team gave us an outline of what will be coming in 6.1. And so, at the start, Matias also walked us through the default theme, with the various style variations. But what else is going to be in WordPress? Is there anything that stands out for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I really enjoyed the product demo, by the way. I know it was very cool to see Matias demo-ing 2023, but also showing how 2023 will interact with some of the new features that have been built into the editor at this point. He especially showed&#8230; One thing I thought especially cool was the zoomed-out view, where you can kind of zoom out and see the full template and kind of interact with things at a container level. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to make it into 6.1 because it&#8217;s still flagged as an experimental feature, but it was so cool to see that and how he was interacting with the style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can really get a sense of the different style variations in that view because you can see so much more of the template. I thought that was very, very cool. And then also tons of interesting new design capabilities that we&#8217;re also playing with in 2023, for example, the fluid typography and the spacing presets. It&#8217;s been really cool to experiment with those in 2023. And I think it&#8217;ll give folks a good example to kind of go out and start using those new features, just kind of referencing what was done in the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially the fluid topography really puts responsiveness right into the editor and to the front end without having to think about view ports or think about other considerations. It just kind of scales if the theme actually happens to use those things naturally. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, yeah, there will also be the new version of the quote block that we talked here on the show about, where you can add inner blocks to the quote block. So you can put a heading in there and images and paragraphs and lists. And then there&#8217;s also a new version of the list block, where each list item is now a block. And you can navigate that a little bit better with up and down. There were also quite a myriad of changes to locking things that started with 6.0, but now it&#8217;s expanded into patterns. You can lock certain blocks and patterns, and you can lock the child. There&#8217;s this: Apply these locks to the blocks inside the container block. And then so these content locks for blocks is really expansion of that. Do you know how that&#8217;s going to work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So I think this one is super interesting. And, like you said, the first kind of iteration of locking controls was released with 6.0, but those were more&#8230; It was almost like a blunt instrument for locking. You could lock down things like movement or removal of a block. But the content lock is such a more nuanced locking control. Right? Because you can lock down the general structure of something, like, say, a pattern, but then restrict the editing capabilities so that folks can&#8217;t kind of take apart the pieces of the pattern. But yet they can still get inside to edit text, make copy tweaks, change out images, that sort of thing. So you have a lot of control over the general structure and the attributes of the pattern, but folks can still get in there and make edits. So I think it&#8217;s a really interesting evolution of the locking controls that were introduced in the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s also a merging of two concepts, one that was in the block editor from the beginning, which was a reusable block, which always tripped a few people up. Because they changed it, and then they changed it all over the site, in that they used it as a pattern, where patterns weren&#8217;t available. And, instead of kind of converting it to regular blocks and then changing, they changed the reusable block, and it was the same over the whole site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think combining those two concepts is probably further down the line, where, yeah, things can be locked down for content or for structure and styling and be a little bit more granular in the lock pieces. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I also think it&#8217;s interesting the way that both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are kind of moving towards the same idea of this container-first editing. It&#8217;s been a real pin point we&#8217;ve seen over the past many releases, is that folks struggle with these kinds of complex block structures, where you have a lot of nested inner blocks. And it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve seen people really struggle with. Especially, in June, we did user testing, as a part of the full site editor outreach program. And we paired with folks and kind of watched them try to make changes in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was something that, over and over again, you see folks struggling with that. They think they&#8217;ve selected a certain level. They think they&#8217;ve selected the parent. But they&#8217;re not actually on the parent and are accidentally changing the wrong level of block. So I think that&#8217;s an issue that we&#8217;ve been trying to come at, from the product design side, of trying to solve that in many different ways. And I think both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are interesting kind of simplifications of the editing process. And the container-first approach, I think, could go a long way towards just general usability and making it super easy to make changes without trying to dig through and figure out which level you&#8217;re at, or are you editing the right block, and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I can see that, yeah, even just thinking about a parent and child kind of concept. And how do you get to the parent when the toolbar then, all of a sudden, changes? And then you&#8217;re looking for some controls in the sidebar, but you have selected the wrong block. Yeah. I can see that. Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some usability there. Sometimes, it&#8217;s also just the complexity of, all of a sudden, you have so much more freedom that these concepts need to be learned first before you even can manage your freedom well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting balance to strike with the interface there. Yeah. And we will have, of course&#8230; What we talked here quite a bit was also for 6.1. There will be more templates available to the site builder, or site owner, to get through the template interface, where you can add new templates for authors and for&#8230; We had the authors and some others. But now it&#8217;s also for custom post types. You can do it for single categories. So you can have, on your site, a category WordPress, a category travel, and a category personal notes. And each one of them can have a different styling on their summary post or on their single post blocks. So that&#8217;s going to be a real change for the capabilities of WordPress at all. Because, before, you actually needed a developer to implement those template changes. And now you can do them all yourself, when you have additional block custom prototypes that are available through plugins and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Agreed. Those are really big changes. And I think we saw a lot of changes there, in 6.0, which kind of expanded template creation capabilities. And it&#8217;s cool to see that continue into 6.1, with it just getting more and more refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then there will also be some developer focused changes, or features, in there. There&#8217;s the big style engine revamp of the consolidation of classes and styles and style variables. Then the team has been working on PHP hooks for the theme JSON file. And, also, there is also a call for testing out, but there&#8217;s also an elements API that, right now, I think, only goes through the theme JSON, where, for any heading, you can have a setting, a styling, in the theme JSON file, without identifying the block or the blocks where those could be used. The same with links and other on buttons. There you can have a general kind of styling for those. And then there will be also settings for the captions, yeah, like the embed. The images have captions. Galleries has a caption. And the embed blocks have captions. And those were only&#8230; You only could do, I think, bold and italics and a link in there, but now you can actually add more settings to them or styling to them but only through the theme JSON. The user interface hasn&#8217;t been built yet, I don&#8217;t think, even designed yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I think you&#8217;re right. It tends to go that way. Right. The capability is added in theme JSON first, and then get around to adding some UI there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like that because then you can actually see what people do with it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there will also be, in the 6.1, a feature where you can use block-based template parts in classic themes. And we have been hearing that quite a lot that, for the classic themes, or those that have doing hybrid themes, if they could gradually adopt block themes, or full site editing, by giving a certain feature, opening up certain features for classic themes. And the template parts have been merged into Gutenberg 14.1 and will be in the beta next week for 6.1. And there is a call for testing and feedback about using it because it&#8217;s the first version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as you know, the first version is never really built out. It kind of does the most important things. But what else is needed? And does it even work? The developers have envisioned that. So it offers you, yeah, as I said, gradual adoption. And it&#8217;s full set editing. Agencies have requested that. And that needs to be testing before we go into release candidate, which is beta. Beta one is September 20th. And then, three weeks after that, which&#8230; Release candidate is on October 11th. So it would be good if your feedback would come in before October 4th, for the last beta, to make some changes to that. And I think that…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a perfect feature for a full site editing call for testing, in my opinion. It&#8217;s just such a major feature. Like you said, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve talked about for a long time. And, obviously, we want to encourage folks to be adopting site editing and all the amazing new capabilities that are possible. And it kind of is an easier barrier for entry or lowers the barrier for entry. And it gives folks an easy way to try it out with their classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it also gives a perfect opportunity for agencies to talk with their customers about one thing that they can offer to them that they can change, like headers, or footers, or maybe sidebar items. So they can both, clients and agencies, can kind of figure out what&#8217;s the balance between being locked down and giving freedom. And I like that. Hopefully, we get quite a few feedback on that before it makes it to 6.1. We also are certainly happy to get the feedback afterwards. But then the change might not happening until 6.2, which is not yet scheduled. But it will come in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That 6.1 is the last major release in 2022, yeah, while we are at it. So I can repeat the dates again. Beta one is September 20th. The scheduled release candidate is, right now, scheduled for October 11. And then the final release is scheduled for November 1st, in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Coming soon to a WordPress instance near you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That brings us to the community contributions of this show. And I have two things. And some of you probably have already heard about it, either through Gutenberg Times or through Twitter. So I had a conversation with Artur Grabowski from the Extendify team, and they have a new product they work with, called Launch. And they work with hosting companies to install the most modern onboarding experience for WordPress customers of the hosting companies. Hosting companies did some research, and they have a relatively high churn rate on 50% of customers leaving for an SAS for software as a service, CMS, also a locked one. And Launch, the Extendify Launch, should help them to help those WordPress customers to onboard. And they give them very personalized information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They ask for the goals for the industry and then have images and copy that is already kind of usable for those verticals and then also have a simultaneous integration for the WordPress instance. Give them a to-do list on: Yeah. What&#8217;s next? Write your about page. And here you need to have your contact form and also include a&#8230; They don&#8217;t include yet anything for third party page builders. But this is so important, when you have ever seen someone who installs WordPress on a hosting company&#8217;s site and then is greeted with a WP admin dashboard. Many people are lost and don&#8217;t know what to do next. And, most of the time, it&#8217;s kind of installed at page builder, which, yeah, it&#8217;s not kind of&#8230; And then they&#8217;re lost for WordPress entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. That sounds like a great project. I can&#8217;t wait to check this out actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It did. So I only saw a demo. I didn&#8217;t get my hands on it yet. But it&#8217;s also very, very new. So they just started talking with the hosting companies. I will share the link in the show notes, so you can check out their website and see what they have planned there. The second interesting conversation&#8230; I had many, many interesting conversations at WordCamp US. And one got really my attention. One was with Aaron Edwards. He demonstrated an early beta version of the Imagine newest product, which is a plugin that brings the magic, as they say, the magic of AI image generation to WordPress. So you give a prompt for an image generation API through that plugin, like a young female assembling blocks in the right corner of a car repair shop kind of thing. And then you get a set of images back indicated. So, in the interface, you can indicate which painter you wanted to kind of feel like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I selected the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. And, in the second set, the Spanish painter Salvador Dali. And it was really interesting to see how that topic kind of changes with the different styles. And, if you haven&#8217;t yet looked, the featured image on the latest post. Weekend edition 2028 actually has an image, a featured image that was AI generated through that plugin. I just heard this morning&#8230; And we are recording this on September 15th. &#8230; That the plugin is now available through the repo. So I will add it to the show notes. Right? Fresh from here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So have you played with any imaging AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ve been playing with Midjourney a lot, way too much. It&#8217;s hard to tear yourself away once you get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really addictive. And Midjourney has-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Have you exceeded your free hundred points or whatever it was?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yes. I immediately upgraded. It was really cool. I mean, obviously, there&#8217;s a ton of cool things that could be done with this new technology and WordPress. So I&#8217;m really excited to check out this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Me too. And I&#8217;m glad that it comes to WordPress all the cool stuff as well because it&#8217;s such a&#8230; Because they used CMS. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I keep having this idea floating around, in the back of my mind, that the jet pack image compare block would be so cool for trying different styles, if you use the exact same prompt but changed the painter, or the art movement, that&#8217;s inspiring the style. And then you could have the image compare block and sort of slide across and see how similar, different the different images are that&#8217;s on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good idea. For demonstration purposes, we can kind of do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this plugin, also, when you give the prompt to it&#8230; And it takes about&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. &#8230; 30, 40 seconds. It&#8217;s not instantaneous. But it&#8217;s very&#8230; You can wait for it, and the anticipation increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then you get four images back. And then you can refine them. And Midjourney has that same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Where you can refine it, and then you can upscale a portion you like, and then you get more details in it. It&#8217;s just, yeah, phenomenal what this does. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And they&#8217;re so much more impressive after you upscale, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Which one was it? I think&#8230; Was it 2027? I spent one morning, on a Sunday, on Midjourney, and I actually had an image in 2027. And 2027 was with Midjourney. And then 2028 was with that plugin. So you already can compare two things right there. Yeah. So, now, from the cool stuff to the cool stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 14.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released? We are looking at the Gutenberg plugin release 14.1 with 59 contributors. And seven of them, new contributors, merged 348 PRs in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a huge number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> That&#8217;s a huge number. I love when you&#8230; The Gutenberg releases, the last few leading up to a major WordPress release, are always so epic. There&#8217;s so many things getting merged at the last moment. It&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And, yeah, no, don&#8217;t fear. We are not going to go through 348 PRs today. There were a lot of PRs that we&#8217;re cleaning up some of the code, or merging something, or migrating something over to a different type script or to switch out Lodash for performance reasons. So that, of course, also contributed to a fair number of PRs. So, yeah, do you want to do us the honor and kind of dive right in into the change log?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So let&#8217;s start with the zoomed-out view that was added to the site editor. We just chatted about that briefly because it was demoed during the 6.0 walkthrough earlier this week. But it is one of the most exciting things, I think, going into this release. And, like I said, it&#8217;s always exciting when you&#8217;re getting close to a major release, and you have all of these features that have been cooking throughout the release cycle. And then you want to try to get them in. Even if this is going to remain experimental for a while and probably not go into the major release, it&#8217;s still really cool to be able to try it in the plugin. So this is something you have to go into the Gutenberg experiments page and actually enable it. So some folks might miss that. You have to turn on this feature in order to be able to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as we mentioned, this is a more container-first approach to editing. It kind of does this really nice zoomed-out effect, where you can see more of the template, above the fold on the page, makes it really easy to select, at a container level, and move around entire sections, really easy to insert new patterns as a new section. And you can imagine that this is just a really easy way to rapidly build out a template from preexisting patterns and making it really easy to, like we were saying before, not get lost in the little granular inner blocks. And you&#8217;re looking at more of the big picture layout structure of your template in this view, which I think is incredibly helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you can then also scroll through, or browse through, all the templates that are on your site and kind of compare them and see what is the same and what is different, just in a great smaller view. But you see the full page of that. So I really like that. Yes. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And another major one, which we also touched on briefly, is the new content locking experience. I had worked a lot on the block locking tools that were released with 6.0. And we had actually tried a couple things around content locking. For example, we tried something on the reusable block, where it would add kind of a click-through overlay. But you wouldn&#8217;t be able to click through the overlay. The overlay would kind of block you from being able to edit the content inside. And I think that was an interesting approach, but it was more of a blunt instrument. And, once we started testing that and looking at how it worked, it occurred to us that, actually, folks probably need to be able to edit some of the content inside. And you don&#8217;t want to remove all of the editing capabilities. You just kind of want to restrict it. So this is a much more nuanced approach, and I&#8217;ve been playing around with it a lot. I think it&#8217;s working really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Yeah. As I said, it&#8217;s the kind of reusable block going to be merged into this idea. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. And then, also, lots of design tools improvements. I think we&#8217;re seeing a lot of typography support being added just across tons of different blocks, with the goal being to get the design tools to a place where they feel really consistent across different blocks. And, if you interact with topography in a certain way on one block, then you go to a different block. It should be familiar. And you should recognize, see, the same controls there. And a ton of PRs in this release. Is this right? Twenty-two more blocks have more typography support enabled. That&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, last release, it was 30. So we&#8217;re coming to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think they&#8217;re 80 blocks. Well, no, 50 blocks about, in there. And I think it&#8217;s now finished with that. In the same round, we&#8230; The typography consistency, typography being available consistently over all the blocks where you need to change the font. Also, the same is true for the spacing supports for blocks. So you can have dimension controls and padding and margin. And you can also step through that and have step sizes there. And it&#8217;s now also available for the gallery block for the common block category list and other blocks, like it was also from the previous release. It&#8217;s a continuation on that. And then what&#8217;s also has been&#8230; And Matias actually demonstrated that also, in the walkthrough of 6.1, that the transformations are gotten a little bit chaotic because they&#8217;re also considered&#8230; Which were mostly used or less used blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you could get an interesting listing of what you can transform a block to. And now there is a decision made that the most used blocks, like paragraph list and quote&#8230; You can kind of have them on the top of the list of all the transforms. So you have always those available, and other blocks actually get additional transformations in this release. The code block can now be transformed to a mere paragraph block, which wasn&#8217;t available before. And, back to the spacing, columns block now also have the axial blocks, X-E-L, block spacing. So you can have spacing on one side of it but not on the other, like you can also do with images. Yeah. You can have a radius on one side, but the others are corners, normal corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. Right. These consistency improvements, I feel like they go such a long way with usability, especially for newcomers who are trying to learn how to use Gutenberg. And it is really helpful, right, if you learn how to change a setting on one block. You come to expect those settings, and you know exactly where to find it. It&#8217;s really nice to see all this movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It really came out great together. And there was a ton of improvements, also, to the navigation block. And I just want to highlight two of those. And you are more than welcome to talk about the others if you wanted to. So there is create a classic navigation menu as draft and for the site editor. So, if there is&#8230; That&#8217;s certainly something to have the migration process from old to new a little bit smoother, that, when you have a classic menu that you wanted to use and that you can go back and forth with it. Not quite sure how that&#8217;s going to work, but it&#8217;s definitely something that has been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Yeah. Definitely smoothing out some rough edges with the navigation block. All of these improvements are little iterative tweaks, but they go a long way towards just making that block feel like more intuitive, like a little smoother to use. I love a few of these. This adding the animation when you open the overlay, I think that&#8217;s so cool. It feels super smooth when you do it. And, even just fixing the position of the X overlay, or the X icon, so it&#8217;s in the exact same position as the icon you use to open the overlay, those are the small tweaks that designers obsess over. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Right. Right. But that make it so easy to spot it when it comes out. And you kind of see it when you&#8217;re using it. Yeah. And now you can even select a different icon for your mobile menu button on that, so…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I love the new icons. Those are great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It doesn&#8217;t have to be a hamburger. It also can be something else. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Those are great. Collectively, all of these improvements to the navigation block, they just make it so much more like customizable and more pixel perfect. I&#8217;m really happy to see all this movement happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The designers are really very happy about that. And here&#8217;s one that I like very much that&#8217;s in the block editor: When you add a link to a paragraph or so, or to a section, and it shows you the latest post and pages in a dropdown box, and now each one of them gets a different icon, so you can distinguish easily by icon: Is it a page? Is it a category page? Or is it a post? So I really like that because then you are sure. Just, if you have a post on a page that have similar titles, yeah, it kind of hard to find the right one, if you don&#8217;t have additional clues in there. So I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. It is really helpful. I had never really thought about it before, but the addition of the icons is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially also because there is this new keyboard shortcut. I don&#8217;t know how new it is. It must be maybe two or three Gutenberg versions before. When you want to do an internal link, you can do just two left brackets, square brackets, and then it gives you a list of all the posts, and you can search on it. And there you will find that too because they use the same component there. So it&#8217;s really interesting to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Nice improvements there. And then we also have some great improvements in this release around patterns. So one of them was post type restriction API for patterns. I believe that&#8217;s where you can restrict patterns that are being inserted based on the post type. So, if you had a really specific post type, like books or something like that, you could have particular patterns that will only appear for that particular post type, which gives a lot more control over what can be inserted there. And another one was allowing remote pattern registration in theme JSON, when core patterns are disabled. I think this was a request from the theme developer community, who would like the ability to disable the core patterns but still be able to include specific patterns from the pattern directory. So, again, more nuanced controls there, which is very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s more like a curation. Even if it&#8217;s not your own patterns, you can kind of select the best five patterns that you think, as a theme developer, those are good to have, and they fit your theme as well. Then you can have them included in the pattern inserted without enabling all the other 800 patterns that are in pattern directory. And-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff in the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: But you do have to kind of search around to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There is a little bit of a quality kind of&#8230; I think we should do a little bit more curation there, in terms of quality of the patterns, but some&#8230; It&#8217;s just how it is, yeah, when the community comes in. You have all qualities, from low to high and in between. And some are cool, but you would never put it on a business website. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: True. True.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s amazing to see how many are there, considering there wasn&#8217;t even a pattern directory maybe a year ago. And just how many community submissions have been added there. It&#8217;s amazing. There&#8217;s a ton of things to choose between. I use it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we didn&#8217;t talk about that. But are there additional patterns that would come with the default theme that you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I don&#8217;t think so. I think we were kind of looking at&#8230; The general approach to the default theme was: Take 2022, and just strip out the opinionated aspects of it, and just make it kind of like a blank canvas approach. And I think we were thinking something similar with the patterns, like almost the exact same patterns as 2022, but maybe strip out some of imagery and whatever else might be included there. I haven&#8217;t really taken a close look at that, but it&#8217;s probably getting to time where we should be taking a look at that. Good reminder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then. Let&#8217;s see. One more thing that was added here. This is to global styles, adding outline support for blocks via theme JSON. That&#8217;s very cool, to give the ability to control the outlines there on buttons and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But it&#8217;s only for the theme JSON right now? No UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: No. Ah, right. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s graphic interface, that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Always good to start there. Let&#8217;s see. And then also theme JSON addition is the ability to style citations. So that was not previously possible. And citations, of course, appear across many different blocks, including, quote, pull quote. So just a little bit more nuanced control there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know quite a few people add that to their normal text. Yeah. They go to custom HML and then put site in. So now this can be styled as an element as well through the theme. So that&#8217;s really&#8230; It&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And, yeah, there&#8217;s also a filter for inner blocks for the navigation block that was added. So developers, like plug-in developers, can add additional menu items to the navigation block without having to worry about the interface for users. A use case for that is to add, for instance, a log out or log in menu to a navigation menu when it&#8217;s necessary. If you want to have just a subscriber only thing, or it&#8217;s for membership plugin or so, that can be added to the navigation block. It took a while to get this in because there was this kind of hesitation to bring something into the block editor without a user interface. But there&#8217;s definitely a use case that Andy Fragin had for it. It was really quite plausible and got approved and merged into this release. So it will be available for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then Grzegorz also worked on the input that&#8217;s more developer oriented, of course, as well, to input individual blocks to your plugin, or, yeah, app, instead of completely input the library. So you can target specific blocks that&#8217;s for your app. And then, another for the block API, there&#8217;s now a render field for the block JSON that will allow you to point to a dynamic block rendering template on your theme or plugin that you need. So you don&#8217;t have to register your rendering page separately. You can just kind of take it from the block JSON meta field, and that&#8217;s now enabled. Yeah. And then we are going to get past a lot of back fixes and back fixes and back fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: A lot. A lot. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A lot. Yeah. Good job, team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Squashing those bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And, yeah, you can definitely kind of go, &#8220;Has my bug been fixed?&#8221; Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some hurrahs around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So finally it&#8217;s been fixed. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s been logging the bugs as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you. It&#8217;s such a major important contribution to actually go through the pain. Sometimes, I say to actually test something that is quirky, and make it so you can make an issue on the Gutenberg repo so people can fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s such a big contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And so many of those bugs come out of the full site editor outreach testing. Folks are constantly uncovering just enhancements and finding bugs and just seeing how things could be improved upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Indeed. For all of us, also some for developers, also kind of pointing out some documentation updates that are already available on the block editor handbook&#8230; And that is that the documentation for the block template parts for the theme support for classic editors, classic themes&#8230; That documentation is already in the repo, I&#8217;m sure. We also will have a developer note out when it hits the 6.1. Also, in the call for testing, there are some instructions there, how to test things. So that is definitely a well-rounded feature release. And then another piece of change is that the doc generation script for JavaScript can now handle a SYMS tag. So, changes into packages and other JavaScript tools that are used with Gutenberg components, you can now see since when this particular feature is available in the documentation. That&#8217;s something that WordPress does quite a bit in their reference guides on the backend side. But, for JavaScript, it was always a little bit cumbersome to get this in. So, now, there is a first version of that available, and we&#8217;ll probably see some more usage of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then, jumping way ahead, we&#8217;re coming almost to the end of the list here. Some updates around themes. We&#8217;ve already talked about block-based template parts for classic themes, which is huge. Do the call for testing that&#8217;s out now. That would be great to get feedback on. Another one that&#8217;s pretty cool is adding the ability to add a gradient overlay for the post featured image block. This was actually something that came up when working on 2023. And someone had submitted a style variation with this idea that you could use a gradient overlay on something like the home template, where you have the post featured image block in the query loop. And, obviously, duo tone is possible there already. But the gradient overlay is kind of a different effect. You can make it a bit bolder. You can play with the opacity there. So it was very, very cool to see that, kind of a rise out of a need. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I think there&#8217;s this long tradition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradient. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There&#8217;s a long, long tradition of default themes kind of influencing features and vice versa, and the product design and the theme development kind of informing each other and working in parallel. And that&#8217;s been really cool to see throughout the course of this release cycle. I think that feature, in particular, was something that it was really cool to see that get added and now will be used in that style variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Which is called pilgrimage, by the way. Coming soon with 2023. And then another really cool one is this new justification controls that you can mess with on a constrained layout. And it will give you the ability to kind of add justification to the inner blocks in a container. So you could have them all go left justified or all go right justified. Again, just a lot more detailed, or more nuanced control, than you ever had there before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Or kind of collecting all the nuanced controls and do it in one step instead of 15.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really like that all. That&#8217;s awesome. I think we&#8230; Did we jump over a few things here? Let me look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Sorry. I may have skipped a couple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No problem. No problem. We can always go back. And, oh, there was one thing that I wanted to mention. Was that you can now pass extra query arguments to the rest API for an accurate preview of the extenders for the query loop. So that is something that, if you do want to add additional arguments, then you can add them to your blocks or to your block variation. And so it&#8217;s more like an extension for developers and theme developers, rather than for AI. Woo Commerce uses that quite a bit and others as well. So, yeah, check that out. The PR has quite a few details in there. And that&#8217;s definitely something that will also be in 6.1 and will have a developer out in the field guide, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But prepare yourself for it. And I think there was&#8230; Oh yeah. And global styles data will also be filterable. There is a first version already in there that you can use global styles default, or global styles blocks, or global styles&#8230; So there&#8217;s this four layers of changes from global styles. Yeah. The default one comes with core. And then each block can have additional filter for the global styles and then as well as the third party blocks. And then the theme has an opinion about how their styles. And then the user can change those styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say, &#8220;Okay, I want a different color. I want a different font. I want a different spacing there. And I want a gradient there.&#8221; And then there are now filters to tap into that, with PHP, to change some of the styling, if there is a need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice. Thanks for explaining that one. I saw it on the list, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. As always, yeah, it&#8217;s the first version. Try it out. I think it would also be a good call for testing for that. But this was also&#8230; It comes often in conversations that plugin developers don&#8217;t want to do their own styling for things. So maybe a default styling but also&#8230; Except some of the things that are theme JSON and just kind of bring them in. So, the block, that also has a front end version of it, kind of feeds seamlessly into a theme or into a site. So that&#8217;s definitely something that people want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But there&#8217;s a lot of that. It went to multiple iterations and just landed now for 14.1. So it&#8217;s going to be real interesting to see what other people do with it. All right. Yeah. You&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s the end of our change log. Wow. We made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> We got through the full list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight, was it, changes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight in 48 minutes or something. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I love it. This is such a great way to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going into Gutenberg, by the way, because it&#8217;s hard to keep up. Things move so quickly. And so this podcast is such an awesome way to just get the overview, this along with the What&#8217;s new in Gutenberg release posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Oh, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: That&#8217;s definitely how I stay up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. Yeah. No. Now you&#8217;ve been a part of it. And thank you for making the time today. So, if people want to get in touch with you and connect with you, what would be a good place for you to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Probably just on the making WordPress Slack. You can always send me a DM. My username is Critterverse. That&#8217;s C-R-I-T-T-E-R-V-E-R-S-E. I totally love to get DMs from folks. And I have folks reaching out to me all the time, especially about the default theme lately. And I&#8217;m always happy to help point you in the right direction, if you want to contribute to Gutenberg or help contribute to the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Would love to help there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Thank you so much. And I don&#8217;t have anything to remind you about, except for: Okay. Beta is coming out September 20th. And all beta testers are asked to test it with the beta tester plugin.

It was wonderful. And I hope you do it again sometime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And thank you all for listening.

I am exhausted from the traveling, from talking to almost 100 people in person, from learning tons in talks and then from catching up with family and work afterwards. It was all worth it, of course. It was exhilarating to meet so many friends again after two years, and to make new ones to geek out about WordPress for four days. I am invigorated from the experience, ready to dive into the upcoming release work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday, I recorded the Gutenberg Changelog episode with the delightful and brilliant Channing Ritter from the WordPress design team. We discuss all the good stuff that&#8217;s coming in with Gutenberg 14.1, WordPress 6.1 and the default theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get going on all the cool things&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a fantastic weekend! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-word-press-release-information\">Developing WordPress and Gutenberg </a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-gutenberg-14-1\">Gutenberg 14.1 </a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">Building Blocks and Tools for the Block editor. </a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-l\">Learn WordPress Online Meetups</a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"0-word-press-release-information\">Developing WordPress and Gutenberg </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A week before Beta 1, the release team held a Product walk-through and discussed what might or might not make it into the release.

This allowed designers to add padding values to their&nbsp;<code>theme.json</code>&nbsp;files and users to adjust it via the Styles panel in the site editor. However, there was one catch. There was no built-in way to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35607\">allow full-width blocks to stretch</a>&nbsp;beyond any horizontal padding and reach the edge of the screen. It was the bane of many theme author’s existence. Sure, they could write custom&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;solutions to address the problem, but that didn’t solve cases where end-users customized things. Eventually, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42085\">issue was fixed</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Gutenberg&nbsp;13.8 and will land in WordPress 6.1.&#8221; </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors have been working on a Distraction-Free version of the editor for the power writers. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> gave it a whirl and reports on the insights: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-make-progress-on-distraction-free-mode\"><strong>Gutenberg Contributors Make Progress on Distraction Free Mode</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp US, many people had conversations about contributing to WordPress open-source project,  Five for the Future and how new contributors can get started.

Contributors are moving functionality around the Navigation interface to figure out where it works best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu selector has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42987\">removed from the Navigation block toolbar</a> in favor of placement in the inspector sidebar. This was done to reduce the crowding in the block toolbar, which previously stitched together disconnected actions, hampering the user experience. Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Carlos Bravo published a gif demonstrating the moved menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This release also adds new features like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43674\">a select icon for the Navigation block&#8217;s menu button</a>. It&#8217;s easy to see how the interface can get crowded fast when adding new capabilities. This particular enhancement was added to the block inspector under Display. If this method works well, contributors may look into adding the ability to add custom icons next.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: Gutenberg PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43674\">#43674</a>  &#8211; Add select icon for Navigation Block&#8217;s menu button\n\n\n\n<p>The 14.1 release also continues the effort of consolidating design tools, adding things like typography and spacing support to Avatar, Button, Avatar, Buttons, Categories List, Comments Links, Latest Posts blocks, and more. This enables easier customization in the editor without the user having to resort to custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month we published an overview of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-make-progress-on-distraction-free-mode\">latest progress on a distraction-free mode </a>for the editor, which included a brief mention of the experimental zoomed-out view that is now available for the site editor. It puts the focus on building and composing patterns, allowing users to move sections around without affecting the inner blocks. Users can build custom templates without worrying about messing up inner blocks. It&#8217;s not on by default but can be enabled under the “Experiments” menu in the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locked patterns with better content locking is also available in 14.1. Features like duotone filters, block alignment, and resizing are now disabled on content-locked blocks, making it easier to keep users from changing the block beyond recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other highlights in 14.1 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Box-shadow support added to theme.json</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Block-based template parts  now available for classic themes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Four new filters to edit the global styles data in PHP</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smoother multi-selection experience</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved block transforms organization with Paragraph, Heading, List and Quote now shown in a separate menu subgroup</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the full changelog in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-1-15-september/\">14.1 release post</a> for a more detailed look at everything that has changed.

It was named for Thaddeus Beaumont, a character in Stephen King&#8217;s <em>The Dark Half</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new theme features the same <a href=\"http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Albert+Sans\">Albert Sans</a> typeface used in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-releases-bjork-a-free-wordpress-block-theme-for-blogs-and-personal-websites\">Björk</a>, his previous release, supported by <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text\">STIX Two Text</a> in text content. Beaumont was inspired by the design he is using on <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/\">his personal website</a>, which Norén said people have requested he make into a theme. It has that faded paper look that instantly puts the focus on text content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The  demo of the single post template has an elegant design with drop caps, pullquotes, a custom &#8220;Preamble with a separator&#8221; pattern, and a minimal previous/next post navigation at the bottom. The spacing and typography are exquisite in this theme and lend themselves to a bit more of a formal presentation for longform content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont comes with nine block patterns, which writers will enjoy, as most of them are dedicated to text presentation. The patterns include a long author bio, short author bio, paragraph with drop cap, paragraph with pullquote aligned left,  paragraph with pullquote aligned right, large pullquote, preamble with a separator, wide quote with diamond separators, and a resume full page pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice a discrepancy in how post content appears in the editor, this is a bug in WordPress, not a problem with the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Currently, text will be set in Albert Sans when you edit your content in the Post Editor, despite it being set in STIX Two Text on the front-end,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;This is because WordPress currently doesn’t apply the core/post-content theme.json settings to the Post Editor preview. This <em>should</em> be fixed in WordPress 6.1, which is scheduled for November 1.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont packages 11 different style variations in the Styles panel that can totally change the look of a website &#8211; a couple of different yellows, multiple dark variations, and several subtle variations on the default. Users can select one and further customize the background, text, links, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Since this theme is geared towards writers, it includes seven different layouts for blog archives, which means users can opt for a more visual display using featured images or keep it simple displaying just titles. These different loops are packaged as Template Parts and can be further edited using the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>View the <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/beaumont/\">demo</a> to see how all the pieces work together or check out the <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/\">Matt Report</a>, an early adopter, to see how a podcast is using the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont would work well as a blog, a writing portfolio, or a resume site, but, thanks to the wide world of blocks, it could also be used as a base for nearly any other type of website. Anders Norén has hit another home run with this theme. It is simple and elegant with just 16K of CSS and no JavaScript, visually distinct from his other themes, and designed for readability. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/beaumont/\">Download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 22:14:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Agency Business Brief for the Week of September 12\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://poststatus.com/agency-business-brief-for-the-week-of-september-12/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5909:\"<div class=\"wp-container-21 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WordPress Founders Invest in Atarim • Gridpane and Automattic Team Up to Serve Agencies • Salary Transparency — Why Not? • Learning Together in Post Status Slack: Adobe\'s Figma Acquisition and PayPal vs. Stripe </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">37</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-founders-invest-in-atarim\">Founders Invest in Atarim</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before <strong>WCUS</strong>, <strong>Vito Peleg</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/blog/atarim-raises-first-funding-round/\">announced</a> <strong>Atarim</strong> has completed <strong>its first funding round</strong> led by <strong>Joost de Valk</strong> and <strong>Marieke van de Rakt</strong>, the founders of <strong>Yoast SEO</strong>, which was acquired by <strong>Newfold Digital</strong> a year ago.

Find out what Piccia learned and why she thinks salary transparency should be a universal practice where it hasn\'t yet become a legal obligation. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Your digital agency gets invited to pitch for a project. You get all the information, the requirements, the objective, and the deliverables. You know you have the right experience, background, and skill sets for it. It’s a potentially life-changing project for a company with a great global reputation, and as an agency, you’d love to have this client on your roster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>But!&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a big spanner in the works. When it comes to talking proper business, the prospective client refuses to disclose the budget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your agency explains patiently that without a budget you won’t be able to work out the best solution: you’d be effectively fumbling in the dark, trying to work out how long a piece of invisible string could possibly be. But the client doesn’t care. (I was going to write “won’t budge,” but it’s a bad pun.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re adamant it should be you to come up with the budget in your quote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Out of 11 positions listed on the Post Status job listings page on 27 July 2022, only the one posted by Codeable publishes a range for the rates their freelancers get paid.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way around this is to get the client to pay you to scope their budget. But usually, this kind of client doesn’t understand that this is a valid investment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consequence, your digital agency has to give up on the pitch because you can’t risk spending time to spec a project without knowing what the budget is. The danger is providing a solution that’s not fit for purpose, getting knocked back for being too expensive, or risking bankruptcy for staying too low.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-always-ask-for-a-budget-don-t-you\">You always ask for a budget – don’t you?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important lesson that I’ve learned from all business coaches I’ve ever listened to, from Chris Do to Michael Killen, is that<em> the first thing that you need to know about a potential client is their budget.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they are not willing to give you a budget, or they tell you they don’t have one, either get the truth out of them somehow or leave the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single time that I have not complied with this rule, it has come back to bite me in the arse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every. Single. Time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why every good bit of agency and freelancer advice about bidding, sales, and discovery says not to let yourself be treated this way. One brilliant example is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U\">Mike Monteiro\'s famous &#8220;Fuck you, pay me&#8221; presentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients usually do indeed know what their budget is, and you typically find out when they finally let you know that your price is, in fact, too high. After they’ve received the quote that you spent a lot of precious time very carefully preparing, usually based on a best-case scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks for your proposal, but –&nbsp;your quote is out of our budget.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, so you <strong>do</strong> have a budget then!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sure that most of you who are business owners agree with this, and you’ve found yourselves in a similar situation, probably more than once, regardless of the size of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the smaller the business, the worse the consequences. It’s exactly the same for freelance operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you, as an agency owner or a freelance operator, quite rightly do not let your time and resources be disrespected by potential clients – and you demand a budget. Always.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-but-do-you-give-one-yourself\">But –&nbsp;do you give one yourself?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s also see what happens when your agency –&nbsp;the agency that just had to give up on a possibly transformative project for lack of financial transparency on the part of the client – decides to post a job listing for a new hire.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We\'ve all heard about imposter syndrome.  Many people have it or are extremely uncomfortable when talking about money because they come from disadvantaged, even abusive backgrounds. They were led to feel shame about their financial situation from an early age. They sometimes can’t believe they now have skills people are willing to shell out good money for, and they’d rather someone else told them what they’re worth.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how important a good team is, and how difficult it is to attract the right fit of talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your job listing contains a detailed job description, the skills and prior experience required, other qualifications you’d like them to have, and some company history describing your wonderful culture rooted in admirable values with great employee benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But no salary range.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same company that dumped a potential new client for lack of budget disclosure is now refusing to disclose its own budget to job candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a real case scenario, but it could well be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of 11 positions listed on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jobs/\">the Post Status job listings page</a> on 27 July 2022, only the one posted by Codeable publishes a range for the rates their freelancers get paid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10 other adverts for full-time positions with companies in the WordPress microcosm do not mention any figure – although some do mention that it might be “generous.” A vague term like that could mean anything at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your adverts post a salary range?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statistically, your answer is very likely to be “NO.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img width=\"653\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-edited-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-122204\" /></div>\n\n\n<p>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-real-life-example\">Real-life example</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a designer. Design opportunities are mysteriously far and few between in the WordPress microcosm, even though ostensibly everything we do requires a design process, as well as interfaces. As a result, when I want a new collaboration I usually leverage existing relationships, or approach companies that I know could be aligned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, in the spring a fantastic design job listing sprang out of nowhere into my field of attention. It was a full-time position, so not what I was looking for. But it also was one of those unicorn jobs that feel like a perfect fit – as if someone had taken the time to write down the ideal job for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a job so dreamy, that I would even have considered losing my beloved freedom and casting aside my other projects for it. I had only ever come across a job description as coated in fairy dust as this one once before in my life. (And I’m fairly long-toothed by now.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagerly scanning the job listing page, I skimmed down to the benefits list. They seemed good and generous, and the company is well-known enough for me to trust them. Still, I couldn’t see any numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I scrutinized the page further: nope.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No salary range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seemed like a high-up position as it contained the word “director,” but –&nbsp;in some companies, a “director” is not necessarily a senior position. I’ve known directors who had just left university and were only directing themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I looked at the application form: it required a CV.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have an up-to-date CV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been extremely lucky in the past few years: I haven’t had to provide a CV. My contracts all came from people who’d seen me in action on stage or online, or had seen my work out in the wild, and wanted to work with me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mere idea of updating my CV filled me with dread. I simply don’t have the time or mental strength –&nbsp;especially when I have no idea what the compensation would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found out who the person I should contact was, and I was glad to read the reply “we’d love you to apply!” They also told me that the salary range was very wide based on experience, and they’d be happy to discuss it in the first interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that discussion required the essential prior step of my application – which, even with an up-to-date CV, would still be a time-consuming, emotionally and mentally demanding process. Knowing myself, it usually takes weeks of work (sadly, I am not exaggerating), including research on the company itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pointed out that “without some sense of salary range for someone with my experience, I have no reasonable way to gauge whether the position is the right fit for my level of seniority or not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never got a reply, ever again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I followed up a few weeks later saying that I know they’re a reputable company, and enquiring whether the position was still open, as it would take me a few days longer to update my CV and portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. No reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really intrigued by this reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for a fact that I was polite and respectful. All I did was explain why I was asking for a salary range, and why I needed it before the first interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went to the Post Status Slack and asked agency owners in there:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That led to a very interesting conversation: especially because every single participant condemned the practice outright. Nobody supported it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, when I checked the listings on the Post Status job board that day, hardly any of them mentioned a salary range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no good living in an echo chamber. I needed to hear from the people who don’t list salaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reasons-why-agencies-and-companies-won-t-post-a-salary-range\">Reasons why agencies and companies won’t post a salary range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went and asked this question —</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>“Why do you not post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?”</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>— directly to every single one of the companies with a job advert on the Post Status page on 27 July 2022. (Except for Codeable because they do include salary ranges in their listings.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I genuinely wanted to know why this practice has been so widely adopted in our community in particular, and in tech in general. When I was hunting for design jobs in London in the Noughties, salaries were <em>always </em>mentioned as part of the title of the job listing. It was a given.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why has this changed so dramatically?<br /><br />A couple of the companies with a listing on the Post Status jobs page at that time answered with genuinely incomprehensible justifications, so I ignored those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others took the time to give me longer answers where they enumerated all the reasons why they won’t post a salary range. And for that, I am thankful. It appears to show that there are no ill intentions. Everyone means well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, to be honest, even in the case of clearer answers, it cost me some effort to actually distill meaningful reasons from the replies I got. My aim here is to present you with an easy-to-read bullet points summary, but it’s taken me a while to parse the meaning, and I’m not sure I managed it in a few cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is the unsatisfactory outcome of my efforts. In no particular order, here are the reasons why those companies chose not to post a salary range:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It’s hard to put a figure on a job. Too high or too low may filter out the right candidate.</li><li>We do disclose when people who apply ask for the range.</li><li>We won’t list when the spread is potentially very large.</li><li>We won’t list when we don’t advertise that position often, thus being open to discussions based on the promise of the candidate.</li><li>When we are willing to consider a wide range of candidates’ skill levels, expectations can be either too low or too high if we publish a salary range.</li><li>Not posting a range can lead to better candidates applying, so we like that flexibility which can lead to good surprises.</li><li>Conversely, posting a range makes it difficult for us to be flexible when someone has no experience but we can see the potential.</li><li>We used to post a range, but as the vast majority of candidates instantly requested the highest range we stopped. We would always offer less whenever they asked for the maximum amount anyway.</li><li>Salary is a &#8220;personalized requirement.&#8221; Someone who is 40 years old and single and lives in Porto, has different requirements from those of someone who is 40 years old and has a family and lives in New York.</li><li>We ask people to give us their preferred salary range. If we cannot afford the request, we’ll respond with our maximum salary.<br />[see <strong>Oh you do have a budget then!</strong> above]</li><li>We think it’s fairer for people to negotiate their preferred salary than for us to disclose our budget.</li><li>Our salaries vary depending on the location of the employee.</li><li>Market prices have gone up and we don’t want current employees to know that we’re paying new recruits more than them.<sup>*</sup></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>*</sup><em>Reason #13 was given to me privately, by a company that told me in confidence. It is not one of those I consulted for this article. They never posted a job on Post Status as far as I know.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reasons-why-candidates-hate-it-when-you-don-t-post-a-salary-range\">Reasons why candidates hate it when you don’t post a salary range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I felt I had a comprehensive range of reasons why companies prefer not to post salary figures – whether or not I could fully grasp their meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1556637508112465922?s=20&t=vx_try6voSZShycZB2-BRQ\">I turned to Twitter to ask candidates</a> what they think and how they feel about job listings that don’t mention compensation in clear, honest figures. I made sure I never expressed my opinion on the thread. (Spoiler alert: I think it’s wrong, in the unlikely case this wasn’t clear yet.)</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J0qiGMP-mNBcFxO4BdC5L_C0563nYEdr8nWiuvQET0lrUudLawjABYdJ8KvPVUrSItGhBfClWK9KfpPQ_a6DRSxPqT9hPQeTMMCRm1ZRENWSYusf4GCGglDKusrKZdaJXJW7HMWiK4uNrIctzK_xwbKnlJty0pO3JRnVbmZqXxWLqSSN1pQ1_Wxf4A\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1556637508112465922?s=20&t=vx_try6voSZShycZB2-BRQ\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whopping 86.7% out of 135 people said that it’s wrong. I asked those who answered “Wrong but understandable” to explain themselves in the comments, but nobody did. As for the 4th option, it was just silly to include it but I had no characters left in the tweet and as you know, you can’t edit a tweet…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comments in that thread confirmed my thoughts, but my reach on Twitter is limited as I’m a lurker who hardly ever posts. So I know that there’s much more to the issue than what the thread highlighted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-why-candidates-really-hate-this-practice\">Why candidates <strong>really</strong> hate this practice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be honest and cut to the chase here. The main reason why anyone looks for a job is that we need money in order to survive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, if I didn’t need money I would probably decide to do other useful and meaningful things with my time, but I doubt I’d be giving a third of my life to an employer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some companies love it when you gush and wax lyrical about how the only and overwhelming reason you’re seeking the honor of being part of their team is your admiration for the company which is so high, that you could not possibly put a monetary value on working there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, borrowing Post Status Editor Dan Knauss’ words: “I consider job application questions soliciting praise for the employer to be forms of another question: &#8216;How much will you abase yourself for us?\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is there\'s only one thing we want to know so we can answer questions like these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How much you are going to pay me in exchange for my time, experience, and skills?</li><li>Are you worth me giving up my freedom?&nbsp;</li><li>Are you worth me connecting my name with your brand?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I want fair compensation for my level of experience. I also want to make sure that you appreciate the depth and range of my skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing that tells me whether a position does the above for me is the salary range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When no salary range is mentioned, a red flag immediately starts waving furiously on my mental horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are you not telling me what your budget is for this position?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because let’s face it: you definitely <strong>do </strong>have a budget. Everybody does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I just wrote a whole list of answers to the above question in this very article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I’m sorry employers, I know that you mean well and this is not personal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, not one single one of the reasons you gave me for your lack of pay transparency begins to persuade me. I don’t feel like any of them is a good enough reason –&nbsp;or better said, it may be good, but only for you. In fact, some of the reasons you provide are actually causing harm to the workforce at large.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sure that most of you are in good faith. I accept that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in actual fact, the lack of pay transparency has ramifications that extend way further than simply not naming a salary range. Those ramifications are just as damaging and end up hurting –&nbsp;as usual – those minorities that some of your ads proclaim you support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the three practices that stem from and go alongside a lack of pay transparency. They are solely to the (apparent) advantage of the recruiter, and to the detriment of the candidate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The cruel mother of them all: Lack of pay transparency.</li><li>With the first wicked child: Pay range varying based on geographical location.</li><li>And the most evil of offsprings: Requesting candidates to name their desired salary.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that all three of these practices are ethically wrong and that they benefit no one – not even the recruiter employing them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By adopting these hiring practices, you create a company culture that probably limits the pool of talent you can draw from, that likely excludes historically marginalized minorities, and that might even create captive workers – instead of happy ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think I’m exaggerating, but I do think I have a point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me also clarify that I don’t want a confrontation here. It is not my aim to shame or accuse anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather, my aim is to prove that it would be first and foremost <strong>in an employer’s best interest</strong> to let candidates know how much you’re willing to pay them for their skills, their talents, their personality, for giving you over a third of their lives and for representing your company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of the many employers in the WordPress microcosm that chooses to not post a salary range, I would love to persuade you that it’s better for you if you are honest and transparent, and if you don’t discriminate on the basis of geography.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please let me first show you the damaging consequences that your adverts trigger when they don’t list a range, and/or ask candidates to name their price, and/or base the compensation on geographical location.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-1-immediate-irritation\">#1 Immediate irritation.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily take for granted that when you do not post a salary range, you will at least irritate roughly 86.7% of your potential candidates. This percentage is based on the extremely small sample of my Twitter poll (135 people) but I actually think it’s a conservative figure. I can’t fathom anyone who wouldn’t be irritated by a job listing that refuses to disclose compensation. Trust me: nobody likes it.

They’ll fear that you are not sure what level of seniority you need for the position, and you expect the candidates to figure that out for you. It’s an internal problem, not a pay range problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I speak from personal experience: it has happened to me at least twice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this seem fair to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it seem efficient?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the time to deeply understand who your company needs –&nbsp;it’s UX work, by the way – and you will be able to better gauge the salary range for the position – with some flexibility, of course, everybody expects that and we’re fine with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, when it comes to range, we are perfectly happy to see a range as wide as 75k to 275k.

And no, we don’t all shoot for the top.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to mention a range like this, it would be an intriguing topic to discuss during that first interview, and I would definitely apply for the job.

Out of all the reasons given for not listing a salary range, this is possibly the least fair – unsurprisingly, it usually goes hand in hand with geographical discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a designer. I am not an expert at negotiating. I hate<strong> </strong>negotiating. I even hate haggling at the market in countries where it’s the norm. Shock horror, I like paying the sticker price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this —&nbsp;or perhaps because of it —&nbsp;I have listened to and read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805\">Chris Voss’s Never Split the Difference</a> at least 5 times, because I do think that negotiation is a life skill we should all have. I am told that as a result, I have become a better negotiator —&nbsp;much to my surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am in my 50s, and I have had time to do this in my long life. Younger people may not. We\'ve all heard about <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/fight-impostor-syndrome/\">imposter syndrome</a>.  Many people have it or are extremely uncomfortable when talking about money because they come from disadvantaged, even abusive backgrounds and/or have an &#8220;invisible disability&#8221; like depression. They were led to feel shame about their financial situation from an early age. They sometimes can’t believe they now have skills people are willing to shell out good money for, and they’d rather someone else told them what they’re worth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell: please don’t expect candidates to be confident talking about money and to have serious negotiation skills, let alone when their livelihood depends on it. You may be making them feel really uncomfortable when they are already in a vulnerable position — which is where we are when we look for a job: we feel vulnerable and exposed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, the candidates, are also not HR experts and we don’t always know how much the position you’re advertising is worth in the current market. Plus, the value of a job varies hugely depending on your type and level of clients, the tasks required, whether you’re fully remote or not, whether you’ll require me to travel, any possible extra time to be expected, and the company culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s for you to know: not the candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because my job is to be a designer and an accessible design advocate. I’m not pitching to be your HR department or your finance director, and I’m most certainly not applying to be an FBI negotiator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you cannot ask me to name my price. I know I would give you the wrong answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same as with the client’s hidden budget, it’s a surefire recipe to shoot myself in the foot – whether I go too far up, or too far down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, I will also&nbsp; tell you&nbsp; who are the categories who will <strong>inevitably </strong>go way too far down when asked to name their own value – because of a myriad of factors starting from inborn low self-esteem, passing through desperately needing to support their family, and ending with the desire to please:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People who identify as women</li><li>People who identify as women of color</li><li>People of color of any gender</li><li>People who are nationals of “developing countries”</li><li>People with disabilities or who identify as disabled</li><li>LGBTQ+ people</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This list can be expanded easily: all you need is empathy and open eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your advert claims that your company champions diversity, but you don’t list a salary range, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/salary-transparency-gender-pay-gap/\">you may not realize that you are probably undermining, excluding, and discriminating against those already marginalized people</a> who would bring their crucial perspective to your workforce and your projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-16 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Editor\'s note: Cory and Michelle have discussed <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/michelle-frechette-on-diversity-and-inclusion-of-underrepresented-groups-in-tech/\">imposter syndrome in the context of diversity and inclusion of underrepresented groups in tech</a>.

Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey have <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome\">helpfully pointed out</a> that &#8220;The answer to overcoming imposter syndrome is not to fix individuals, but to create an environment that fosters a number of different leadership styles and where diversity of racial, ethnic, and gender identities is viewed as just as professional as the current model.&#8221;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-11-pay-range-based-on-geographical-location-is-not-fair\">#11 Pay range based on geographical location is not fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that everyone does it. Automattic does it, Google does it, Slack does it, Meta does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benefitnews.com/news/location-based-salary-does-not-promise-equal-pay\">It still doesn’t make it fair</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, pay based on geographical location is one of the reasons listed for not publishing a salary range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not a good reason, because you could still publish the different ranges you apply to the different areas. Why don’t you do that? Does it mean that you are ashamed of the difference in compensation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salary is most definitely not a “personalized requirement.” There is no way for you to know whether someone who is 40 years old and single in Porto needs less money than someone of the same age who is in New York and has a family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the same token, you should be asking candidates about their personal circumstances and tailoring their compensation according to their answers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you going to lower their salary if they disclose that they have private money?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, will you make it higher should they confess that they are crippled by debt? Would these even be legal questions to ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The person in Porto could be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helping out with family debt</li><li>Supporting ailing parents</li><li>Supporting an out-of-work sibling</li><li>Living with an illness that requires extra expenses</li><li>Dealing with personal issues of any kind</li><li>None of our business!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You are paying for skills, talent, and experience. You are paying for the value the employee will bring to your company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the same everywhere. Regardless of geographical location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This raises another genuine question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about digital nomads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The person who is in New York may decide to move to Porto for a few months. Are you going to adjust their salary accordingly for the duration of their stay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, they may want to work from Mexico for a while, because why not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you going to apply the “Mexico rate” to their monthly cheque?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they’ll go to Thailand, probably even cheaper than Mexico. Will their monthly salary keep going down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a pattern is emerging, and it’s one that shows that compensation on the basis of location gets dangerously close to being in fact on the basis of ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I accept that there may not be any evil intention and this may be an unconscious bias, but it might well be what you’re ending up doing – without meaning to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, for legal reasons you might not be able to give your employee in a “cheaper” country the same benefits that the ones in your own country enjoy. Usually, they have to be external contractors, even when they’re on a “permanent” contract, so they’re already losing out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important point to make is that those “adjusted” salaries hardly ever reflect the lived situation on the ground. No matter how painstakingly they adhere to official numbers and stats such as the cost of living index, and so on. The compensation adjusted according to geography usually does not have the same buying power as the “real” salary, the one based on more expensive locations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://careers.ibm.com/job/14243721/devops-engineer-remote/?codes=IBM_CareerWebSite\">IBM is offering a DevOps engineer role in Slovakia</a> for a gross salary of €2,300 a month. No range, that’s the only figure they mention. That’s around $27,000 (USD) a year considering that the euro and dollar are nearly equal in value right now. <a href=\"https://careers.ibm.com/job/15276215/devops-engineer-remote/?codes=IBM_CareerWebSite\">A similar role for the same company in Colorado, with exactly the same job title</a>, offers a pay range between $75,000 and $145,000 a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life in Colorado is not 3 to 6 times more expensive than in Slovakia. You don’t go very far on €27k a year gross in Slovakia, considering that rental prices for a 2-bed apartment in the capital, Bratislava, vary between 600 and 1000 euros. And that’s without utilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, life is way more expensive than you think in Slovakia/Thailand/India/Mexico/insert “cheaper” country here. Please consider that you might be doing your highly skilled workforce an injustice when you shortchange them and stunt their lifestyle and development, for the benefit of their peers living in the “first” world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can personally comment on the issues raised by pay based on geographical location because I am a living demonstration of the fallacy of the system. I lived in London for a couple of decades, and then I moved to Valencia in 2016. For a variety of reasons, from the tax burden on sole traders to the lack of suitable office space, I am finding Valencia quite expensive as a solopreneur. Believe it or not, running my freelance business was WAY cheaper in London. Seriously. I can provide details to those interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, unless your company offers truly amazing other perks (I know that Automattic probably falls into this category and most of their employees never want to leave), you’re running the risk of seeing them&nbsp;leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, however, at least one argument in favor of a higher salary for staff living in ridiculously expensive locations such as New York, London, LA, Singapore, Hong Kong, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s a “location boost,” in case the employer actually needs the employee to live in that location, in order to take meetings, see clients, attend conferences, network, and so on. In that case, it is absolutely fair, and I would add necessary, to compensate the employee for the extra cost that living in an expensive metropolis entails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-if-there-was-a-better-way-that-still-lets-you-be-a-vip-wordpress-agency\">What if there was a better way – that still lets you be a VIP WordPress agency?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this research, I also came across a number of companies that make a point of always listing salary ranges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them have built their company ethos around their hiring practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are highly successful companies, so it seems to me that listing a salary range can’t be that damaging after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they do even more. They believe that the way they treat their prospective employees at the beginning is how they will treat them later. They know that their own brand will be shaped by the way candidates feel about them. And they already realize that not telling candidates how much they’re willing to compensate them creates a power imbalance that hurts historically disadvantaged groups the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what they do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They always post a salary range.</li><li>They offer the same compensation everywhere. It’s about the value you bring to the company, which has nothing to do with your location.</li><li>They don’t demand that you provide a CV to apply.</li><li>They don’t require you to have an up-to-date portfolio.</li><li>They don’t want you to write a cover letter.</li><li>They don’t need you to have a college degree.</li><li>They pay you when you’re asked to do a trial.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lance Robbins from <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> told me:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“XWP always gives a range and I always advocate for this.

Not only are you not required to provide a resume when applying for a job at Knucklepuck: you’re actually not allowed to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brett pointed out to me that the art of writing an effective resume is one that’s usually taught at institutions of higher education that might be very expensive to attend. As a result, those who already had an easier start to their working life are handed out another unfair advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also remarked that reading resumes is a time-consuming process even for the employers themselves: it might take the candidate weeks of toil to perfect a resume which is then only skimmed through by the employer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an inefficient, outdated, and unfair process that ends up benefitting no one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I completely agree, also because even when your CV is up to date, you have to tailor it again for different positions, to highlight the part of your experience that’s more relevant to the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same thing applies to portfolios, and it’s easily circumvented by asking candidates to present 2 or 3 projects that they believe are significant relative to the role. This is what XWP do, too, and I highly commend them for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not skip that step then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has done a fair bit of hiring in her life –&nbsp;let me wear my design department director hat right now, instead of the candidate’s one – I can assure you that most people lie on their CVs, or at least they embellish the truth in order to impress the recruiter. We’ve all done it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am absolutely sure that you can hire the right fit of talent without a CV or a portfolio – and without having to hand in a silly, out-of-context task project that proves zero about their ability to perform in their role at best, exposing them to their ideas being stolen at worst (yes, that definitely happens).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, because I’ve had to fire people that had been hired before my time. They had presented a great CV as well as the required task. They were completely wrong for the role anyway. Firing someone is not pleasant, I can assure you, and it’s a huge waste of time and resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their successors in the role, in case you’re wondering, brought their best projects instead of a portfolio, didn’t need to do a task, and lasted in their positions respectively 8 and 12 years, in both cases leaving of their own volition, after having provided huge value to the institution they designed for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-you-ready-for-big-changes\">Are you ready for big changes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you feel right now? If you are one of those who avoid posting ranges for whatever reason – have I upset you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes being told that what they’re doing is wrong, so you might well take to Twitter now and @ me with all your indignation (my handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia\">@Piccia</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png\" alt=\"😎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As said above – I come in peace.
